TI  - Generative AI meets copyright
T2  - SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology that is widely adopted by members of the general public as well as scientists and technologists who are enthusiastic about the potential to accelerate research in a wide variety of fields. But some professional artists, writers, and programmers fiercely object to the use of their creations as training data for generative AI systems and to outputs that may compete with or displace their works (1, 2). Lack of attribution and compensation for use of their original creations are other sources of aggravation to critics of generative AI. Copyright lawsuits that are now underway in the United States have substantial implications for the future of generative AI systems. If the plaintiffs prevail, the only generative AI systems that may be lawful in the United States would be those trained on public domain works or under licenses, which will affect everyone who deploys generative AI, integrates it into their products, and uses it for scientific research.

AB  - Generative AI based on large-language models is significantly impacting software development through IDE assistants, cloud-based APIs, and interactive chatbots for coding assistance. It excels in generating and translating code and data, navigating APIs, and creating boilerplate content, thereby enhancing productivity. However, it is prone to generating inaccurate information ("hallucinations"), erroneous code, and potentially introducing security vulnerabilities. To counter these risks, employing automated analysis tools, conducting rigorous testing, and maintaining a deep understanding of computer science concepts are essential. While generative AI can substantially aid development tasks it is not a replacement for human expertise, especially in understanding complex software, its requirements, and architecture.

AB  - Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has impressed the world with its ability to create text, images, and videos. However, there are still areas in which GAI produces undesirable or unintended results due to being "uncertain". Before wider use of AI-generated content, it is important to identify concepts where GAI is uncertain to ensure the usage thereof is ethical and to direct efforts for improvement. This study proposes a general pipeline to automatically quantify uncertainty within GAI. To measure uncertainty, the textual prompt to a text-to-image model is compared to captions supplied by four image-to-text models (GIT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP). Its evaluation is based on machine translation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and SPICE) and word embedding's cosine similarity (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, DistilRoBERTa, MiniLM-6, and MiniLM-12). The generative AI models performed consistently across the metrics; however, the vector space models yielded the highest average similarity, close to 80%, which suggests more ideal and "certain" results. Suggested future work includes identifying metrics that best align with a human baseline to ensure quality and consideration for more GAI models. The work within can be used to automatically identify concepts in which GAI is "uncertain" to drive research aimed at increasing confidence in these areas.

AB  - With the evolution of generative AI systems, machine-made productions in the literary and artistic field have reached a level of refinement that allows them to replace human creations. The increasing sophistication of AI systems will inevitably disrupt the market for human literary and artistic works. Generative AI systems provide literary and artistic output much faster and cheaper. It is therefore foreseeable that human authors will be exposed to substitution effects. They may lose income as they are replaced by machines in sectors ranging from journalism and writing to music and visual arts. Considering this trend, the question arises whether it is advisable to take measures to compensate human authors for the reduction in their market share and income. Copyright law could serve as a tool to introduce an AI levy system and ensure the payment of equitable remuneration. In combination with mandatory collective rights management, the new revenue stream could be used to finance social and cultural funds that improve the working and living conditions of flesh-and-blood authors.

AB  - There is a history of thinking that photographs provide a special kind of access to the objects depicted in them, beyond the access that would be provided by a painting or drawing. What is included in the photograph does not depend on the photographer's beliefs about what is in front of the camera. This feature leads Kendall Walton to argue that photographs literally allow us to see the objects which appear in them. Current generative algorithms produce images in response to users' text prompts. Depending on the parameters, the output can resemble specific people or things which are named in the prompt. This resemblance does not depend on the user's beliefs, so generated images are in this sense like photographs. Given this parallel, how should we think about AI-generated images?

AB  - Generative AI appears to threaten argument creativity. Because of its capacity to generate coherent texts, individuals are likely to integrate its ideas, and not their own, into arguments, thereby reducing their creative contribution. This article argues that this view is mistaken-it rests on a misunderstanding of the nature of creativity. Within arguments, creative and critical thinking cannot be separated. Because creativity is enmeshed with skills such as analysis and evaluation, the use of generative AI in the construction of arguments, especially in the role as universal audience, has the potential to heighten, not diminish argument creativity.

AB  - AI has been used for years to improve collection and analysis in signals intelligence but this article explores the range of tasks generative AI can perform for strategic intelligence analysts. It argues that the most prudent integration of generative AI into intelligence assessment is as a 'co-pilot' for human analysts. Notwithstanding issues of inaccuracy, imported bias and 'hallucination', generative AI can liberate time-poor analysts to focus on tasks where humans add most value - applying their expertise, tacit knowledge and 'sense of reality'.

AB  - Designing building structures presents various challenges, including inefficient design processes, limited data reuse, and the underutilization of previous design experience. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for learning and creatively using existing data to generate new design ideas. Learning from past experiences, this technique can analyze complex structural drawings, combine requirement texts, integrate mechanical and empirical knowledge, and create fresh designs. In this paper, a comprehensive review of recent research and applications of generative AI in building structural design is provided. The focus is on how data is represented, how intelligent generation algorithms are constructed, methods for evaluating designs, and the integration of generation and optimization. This review reveals the significant progress generative AI has made in building structural design, while also highlighting the key challenges and prospects. The goal is to provide a reference that can help guide the transition towards more intelligent design processes.

AB  - We are witnessing an accelerated technological evolution that has enabled the development of artificial intelligence in various fields, allowing it to gradually infiltrate the entire society. We intend to cover only a small subset of AI technologies in our paper, that of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Our objectives are to shed light on the legal issues that GenAI can cause and to find solutions to them. We begin with a definition of GenAI in the much broader context of AI technologies. Answers to a few essential questions are to be found: 'How does GenAI work?', 'What could GenAI be used for?', 'What legal issues could arise from using a GenAI?'. To accomplish our goals, we first conduct a literature review to define artificial intelligence (AI) in general and GenAI in particular. Several lawsuits are chosen to illustrate the magnitude of the legal problems and to test the feasibility of possible solutions in both the national and EU legal systems. Then, we analyse GenAI's output, liability for its contents and for its use, altogether with examples of related contractual clauses.

We present a comparison of game design proposal cases conducted by a game designer over a span of four years, showcasing how the utilization of artificial intelligence is re-empowering game designers. We envision a empowered game designer capable of market sensing, artwork creation, playable prototype development, subsequent game analysis, and operations all by oneself or with a very small team, a "super game designer". This paper illustrates how AI is ushering in a new era for game designers, and discusses the potential to stimulate innovation within the game industry by fostering creativity and imagination of game designers.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the effects of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on the news media market. We model a representative consumer who allocates their time between reading news and deceptive articles. We find that GenAI may induce consumers to inefficiently reallocate their time and increase the consumption of the lower value good, i.e. deceptive content (clickbait articles or fake news). Therefore, early-stage GenAI distorts the incentives of consumers and reduces their welfare. After GenAI technology reaches a certain threshold, however, consumers start benefiting from its advancements. Finally, we find that the negative effects of early-stage GenAI are exacerbated as they induce a lower level of investment in news production.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The introduction of accessible generative artificial intelligence opens promising opportunities for the implementation of personalized learning methods in any educational environment. Personalized learning has been conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently become realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we propose an affordable and sustainable approach toward personalizing learning materials as part of the complete educational process. We have created a tool within a pre-existing learning management system at a software engineering college that automatically generates learning materials based on the learning outcomes provided by the professor for a particular class. The learning materials were composed in three distinct styles, the initial one being the traditional professor style and the other two variations adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday Addams. Each lesson, besides being delivered in three different formats, contained automatically generated multiple-choice questions that students could use to check their progress. This paper contains complete instructions for developing such a tool with the help of large language models using OpenAI's API and an analysis of the preliminary experiment of its usage performed with the help of 20 college students studying software engineering at a European university. Participation in the study was optional and on voluntary basis. Each student's tool usage was quantified, and two questionnaires were conducted: one immediately after subject completion and another 6 months later to assess both immediate and long-term effects, perceptions, and preferences. The results indicate that students found the multiple variants of the learning materials really engaging. While predominantly utilizing the traditional variant of the learning materials, they found this approach inspiring, would recommend it to other students, and would like to see it more in classes. The most popular feature were the automatically generated quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding. Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of various versions of learning materials leads to an increase in students' study time, especially for students who have not mastered the topic otherwise. The study's small sample size of 20 students restricts its ability to generalize its findings, but its results provide useful early insights and lay the groundwork for future research on AI-supported educational strategies.

AB  - This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the ways in which users process and respond to misinformation in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) contexts. Drawing on the heuristic-systematic model and the concept of diagnosticity, our approach examines a cognitive model for processing misinformation in GenAI. The study's findings revealed that users with a high-heuristic processing mechanism, which affects positive diagnostic perception, were more likely to proactively discern misinformation than users with low-heuristic processing and low-perceived diagnosticity. When exposed to misinformation from GenAI, users' perceived diagnosticity of misinformation can be accurately predicted by the ways in which they perform heuristic systematic evaluations. With this focus on misinformation processing, this study provides theoretical insights and relevant recommendations for firms to be more resilient in protecting users from the detrimental impacts of misinformation.

AB  - Proponents of generative AI tools claim they will supplement, even replace, the work of cultural production. This raises questions about the politics of visibility: what kinds of stories do these tools tend to generate, and what do they generally not? Do these tools match the kind of diversity of representation that marginalized populations and non-normative communities have fought to secure in publishing and broadcast media? I tested three widely available generative AI tools with prompts designed to reveal these normative assumptions; I prompted the tools multiple times with each, to track the diversity of the outputs to the same query. I demonstrate that, as currently designed and trained, generative AI tools tend to reproduce normative identities and narratives, rarely representing less common arrangements and perspectives. When they do generate variety, it is often narrow, maintaining deeper normative assumptions in what remains absent.

AB  - Generative AI is regarded as a major disruption to software development. Platforms, repositories, clouds, and the automation of tools and processes have been proven to improve productivity, cost, and quality. Generative AI, with its rapidly expanding capabilities, is a major step forward in this field. As a new key enabling technology, it can be used for many purposes, from creative dimensions to replacing repetitive and manual tasks. The number of opportunities increases with the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs). This has raised concerns about ethics, education, regulation, intellectual property, and even criminal activities. We analyzed the potential of generative AI and LLM technologies for future software development paths. We propose four primary scenarios, model trajectories for transitions between them, and reflect against relevant software development operations. The motivation for this research is clear: the software development industry needs new tools to understand the potential, limitations, and risks of generative AI, as well as guidelines for using it.

AB  - Objective This study evaluates an AI assistant developed using OpenAI's GPT-4 for interpreting pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing results, aiming to improve decision-making and knowledge sharing in clinical genetics and to enhance patient care with equitable access.Materials and Methods The AI assistant employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which combines retrieval and generative techniques, by harnessing a knowledge base (KB) that comprises data from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). It uses context-aware GPT-4 to generate tailored responses to user queries from this KB, further refined through prompt engineering and guardrails.Results Evaluated against a specialized PGx question catalog, the AI assistant showed high efficacy in addressing user queries. Compared with OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, it demonstrated better performance, especially in provider-specific queries requiring specialized data and citations. Key areas for improvement include enhancing accuracy, relevancy, and representative language in responses.Discussion The integration of context-aware GPT-4 with RAG significantly enhanced the AI assistant's utility. RAG's ability to incorporate domain-specific CPIC data, including recent literature, proved beneficial. Challenges persist, such as the need for specialized genetic/PGx models to improve accuracy and relevancy and addressing ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns.Conclusion This study underscores generative AI's potential for transforming healthcare provider support and patient accessibility to complex pharmacogenomic information. While careful implementation of large language models like GPT-4 is necessary, it is clear that they can substantially improve understanding of pharmacogenomic data. With further development, these tools could augment healthcare expertise, provider productivity, and the delivery of equitable, patient-centered healthcare services.

AB  - Our paper formalizes a production function to give microeconomic foundations for the adoption of Generative AI (GAI) within workplaces. The production function accounts for task-interdependencies, the worker-GAI interaction and indistinguishability between human-created and AI-generated outputs. We show that workers and GAI represent two distinct but interdependent sides of the production, that jointly generate a network externality in learning that drives productivity. We find that in open learning organizations favoring the worker-GAI interaction, GAI should be matched to workers based on their ability to detect errors. We analyze configurations where the worker-GAI interaction is limited, referred as closed learning organizations, including firms banning the use of GAI, technological superclusters and emergence of small entrepreneurs innovating with GAI.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for overseeing that applications of artificial intelligence are ethically implemented and applied. With the expanding use of Generative AI (GAI) such as ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, and DeepMind, and the growing adoption of these technologies in Human Resource Development (HRD), there is a pressing need to address the ethical implications of these technologies. The challenges associated with AI and GAI include bias, fairness, transparency, safety and control, displacement and job loss, privacy intrusion, humanity, and agency. These concerns have significant implications for HRD practices and the broader organisational ecosystem. However, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks and guidelines to address the related ethical challenges these technologies present, ensuring the responsible and humane use of AI and GAI in HRD. There is a need to push the boundaries of thinking about the impact of AI in HRD and develop a comprehensive framework for guiding the ethical applications of AI and GAI in HRD practices, promoting fairness, transparency, and privacy. This paper provides a comprehensive framework of practices for addressing these challenges.

AB  - In today's world, the development of social network services (SNS) like Facebook and Instagram has enabled consumers to acquire information about products through various channels. The acquisition of diverse information has led to a diversification in consumer preferences and requirements. As consumer preferences diversify and online channels expand, there is an increasing need for companies to provide personalized marketing. Among the means of personalized marketing, personalized marketing messages are a key tool that can enhance customer engagement. However, a limitation of personalized marketing message services is the cost issue associated with manually writing individual marketing messages for personalization. To solve this problem, when developing automated technology for personalized marketing messages, there were concerns about the complexity of model development and the quality of messages generated automatically. In this study, we propose the Persuasive Message Intelligence (PMI) service, which utilizes the recently prominent Large Language Model for automated individual personalized marketing messages. PMI generates marketing messages through prompt engineering based on the theory of persuasion in marketing and prior research on AI-generated messages, and validates the elements of prompts through surveys. The trial and error of researchers presented in this study, along with the know-how and rules of prompt engineering, will serve as guidelines for those who wish to develop services through prompts in the future.

AB  - Generative AI has taken the world by storm, kicked off for real by ChatGPT and quickly followed by further development and the release of GPT-4 and similar models from OpenAI's competitors. The street has most certainly found its use for generative artificial intelligence (AI), and there is no longer much point in discussing whether generative AI will be influential. It will, and what remains to be discussed it how influential it will be, and what potential harms arise when we use AI to generate text and other forms of content. Technological change entails societal change, and we must always endeavor to ask how new technologies shapes, engenders, or potentially erodes the "good society". In this sense, Generative AI is another instance of politically and culturally disruptive autonomous technology, and in this short commentary I highlight some of the key questions to be asked regarding consequences on the micro, meso, and macro level.

AB  - We have all read the headlines heralding, often hyperbolically, the latest advances in text- and image-based Artificial Intelligence (AI). What is perhaps most unique about these developments is that they now make relatively good AI accessible to the average Internet user. These new services respond to human prompts, written in natural language, with generated output that appears to satisfy the prompt. Consequently, they are categorized under the term "generative AI," whether they are generating text, images, or other media. They work by modeling human language statistically, to "learn" patterns from extremely large datasets of human-created content, with those that specifically focus on text therefore called Large Language Models (LLMs). As we have all tried products such as ChatGPT or Midjourney over the past year, we have undoubtedly begun to wonder how and when they might impact our archaeological work. Here, I review the state of this type of AI and the current challenges with using it meaningfully, and I consider its potential for archaeologists.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT offer significant potential in the corporate world and organizational leadership. Organizations are actively integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into their operations to leverage its benefits. However, research is yet to explore the factors supporting the continuity of GenAI-powered Optimization Intelligence (GenAI-OI) processes in organizational contexts. This study seeks to address this gap by focusing on the challenges of standardizing such optimization intelligence systems. It utilizes the Normalization Process Theory (NPT) to facilitate a theoretical exploration of this standardization process. From both a research and practical standpoint, it elucidates how NPT can be applied to provide a structured framework for understanding and theorizing the processes involved in embedding and sustaining GenAI-OI systems, which play a pivotal role in shaping the future of organizational agility. This research endeavors to uncover valuable insights for organizations seeking not only to adopt but sustain this technology effectively.

AB  - With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), this study aims to examine the interplay among the perceived usability, perceived enjoyment, perceived responsiveness, and intention to continue using ChatGPT. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate our proposed model. We recruited 446 ChatGPT users through an online survey conducted on the Connect platform, powered by CloudResearch. Perceived usability (beta = 0.254) and enjoyment (beta = 0.438) significantly influence satisfaction with ChatGPT. However, perceived responsiveness is not significantly related to perceived attachment or satisfaction. Furthermore, we established that perceived attachment (beta = 0.405) and satisfaction (beta = 0.447) are pivotal in shaping users' intentions to continue using ChatGPT, providing insights into human-AI interactions. The practical implications of our findings suggest that generative AI chatbots should be crafted with a focus on enjoyable, user-centered interfaces that foster long-term user satisfaction and engagement. AI developers should design AI conversation flows and chatbot personas to optimize the user experience.

TI  - Medical domain knowledge in domain-agnostic generative AI
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - The text-guided diffusion model GLIDE (Guided Language to Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing) is the state of the art in text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (AI). GLIDE has rich representations, but medical applications of this model have not been systematically explored. If GLIDE had useful medical knowledge, it could be used for medical image analysis tasks, a domain in which AI systems are still highly engineered towards a single use-case. Here we show that the publicly available GLIDE model has reasonably strong representations of key topics in cancer research and oncology, in particular the general style of histopathology images and multiple facets of diseases, pathological processes and laboratory assays. However, GLIDE seems to lack useful representations of the style and content of radiology data. Our findings demonstrate that domain-agnostic generative AI models can learn relevant medical concepts without explicit training. Thus, GLIDE and similar models might be useful for medical image processing tasks in the future - particularly with additional domain-specific fine-tuning.

AB  - Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including recent generative forms, are significantly impacting our lives and work. A key aspect of our work as IS researchers is the publishing of research articles, for which peer review serves as the primary means of quality control. While there have been debates about whether and to what extent AI can replace researchers in various domains, including IS, we lack an in-depth understanding of how AI can impact the peer review process. Considering the high volume of submissions and limited reviewer resources, there is a pressing need to use AI to augment the review process. At the same time, advances in AI have been accompanied by concerns about biases introduced by AI tools and the ethics of using them, among other issues such as hallucinations. Thus, critical issues to understand are: how can AI augment and potentially automate the review process, what are the pitfalls in doing so, and what er the implications for IS research and peer review practice. I will offer my views on these issues in this opinion piece.

AB  - Higher educational institutions (HEIs) are facing a significant challenge in maintaining academic integrity due to the technological integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The widespread use of AI tools by college students has resulted in an increase in plagiarism and cheating, highlighting the need for effective implementation of this technology. However, there is a lack of research on the best practices for using AI in academic settings. HEIs must take responsibility for addressing these issues, as the majority of institutions do not have formal guidelines for AI use, leading to confusion among students and instructors. To combat academic misconduct, HEIs should establish clear objectives and policies for the equitable, inclusive, and ethical use of AI. Improving AI literacy among students and faculty is crucial, as it ensures that everyone has equal access to technology, preventing a digital divide. Moreover, proactive education on the ethical use of AI is vital for HEIs to prepare students for the AI-driven future of education and maintain academic integrity.

Generative AI (GenAI) has demonstrated potential in creating novel synthetic promoters with significantly enhanced functionality. However, these methods' reliance on various programming frameworks and specific task-oriented contexts limits their flexibilities. Overcoming these limitations is essential for researchers to fully leverage the power of GenAI to design promoters for their tasks.Results Here, we introduce GPro (Generative AI-empowered toolkit for promoter design), a user-friendly toolkit that integrates a collection of cutting-edge GenAI-empowered approaches for promoter design. This toolkit provides a standardized pipeline covering essential promoter design processes, including training, optimization, and evaluation. Several detailed demos are provided to reproduce state-of-the-art promoter design pipelines. GPro's user-friendly interface makes it accessible to a wide range of users including non-AI experts. It also offers a variety of optional algorithms for each design process, and gives users the flexibility to compare methods and create customized pipelines.Availability and implementation GPro is released as an open-source software under the MIT license. The source code for GPro is available on GitHub for Linux, macOS, and Windows: https://github.com/WangLabTHU/GPro, and is available for download via Zenodo repository at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10681733.

AB  - In a world increasingly shaped by generative AI systems like ChatGPT, the absence of benchmarks to examine the efficacy of oversight mechanisms is a problem for research and policy. What are the structural conditions for governing generative AI systems? To answer this question, it is crucial to situate generative AI systems as regulatory objects: material items that can be governed. On this conceptual basis, we introduce three high-level conditions to structure research and policy agendas on generative AI governance: industrial observability, public inspectability, and technical modifiability. Empirically, we explicate those conditions with a focus on the EU's AI Act, grounding the analysis of oversight mechanisms for generative AI systems in their granular material properties as observable, inspectable, and modifiable objects. Those three conditions represent an action plan to help us perceive generative AI systems as negotiable objects, rather than seeing them as mysterious forces that pose existential risks for humanity.

AB  - The advent of generative AI has caused both excitement and anxiety among educators. Some school systems have gone so far as to ban it altogether. Generative AI has the potential to transform human learning; but like any new technology, it has both strengths and weaknesses, and adopting it involves some risks. There are risks that generative AI will mislead learners with wrong information, or that learners will use it to do their homework and take tests for them. This article presents some ways to take best advantage of generative AI, while managing and mitigating the risks. It also suggests some uses of generative AI to avoid. These insights are informed by learning science and extensive experience developing AI-enabled learning products. If applied properly, generative AI can dramatically accelerate human learning and do so at scale.

AB  - To understand why and how marketing educators can best use generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, this article integrates a literature survey, interviews with both marketing educators and managers, and surveys of both marketing educators and students. In leveraging these inputs, the authors argue that generative AI can significantly shape and improve the future of marketing education. Specifically, by including ChatGPT in their lessons, marketing educators can both materially enhance learning experiences and better prepare students for future jobs with marketing firms that rely on ChatGPT in practice. Noting that ChatGPT has downsides, this research identifies several steps educators should take to minimize the risks. Finally, the authors propose an agenda for continued research into how marketing educators can and should use ChatGPT, with the explicit recognition that ChatGPT is evolving rapidly, so that, the research agenda will need to adapt as well.

TI  - The health risks of generative AI-based wellness apps

KW  - SEEKING
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled chatbots are increasingly being used to help people manage their mental health. Chatbots for mental health and particularly 'wellness' applications currently exist in a regulatory 'gray area'. Indeed, most generative AI-powered wellness apps will not be reviewed by health regulators. However, recent findings suggest that users of these apps sometimes use them to share mental health problems and even to seek support during crises, and that the apps sometimes respond in a manner that increases the risk of harm to the user, a challenge that the current US regulatory structure is not well equipped to address. In this Perspective, we discuss the regulatory landscape and potential health risks of AI-enabled wellness apps. Although we focus on the United States, there are similar challenges for regulators across the globe. We discuss the problems that arise when AI-based wellness apps cross into medical territory and the implications for app developers and regulatory bodies, and we outline outstanding priorities for the field.
   AI-enabled wellness apps exist in a regulatory gray area and may pose risks if used to manage mental health issues; this Perspective outlines the possible risks to users and the implications for app developers and regulators.

TI  - StyleGAN-Based Advanced Semantic Segment Encoder for Generative AI
T2  - IT PROFESSIONAL
LA  - English
KW  - FIDELITY GAN INVERSION
AB  - StyleGAN is a widely used model in various AI domains that generates high-quality images. It has many advantages but has the disadvantage of per-pixel noise inputs. These noise inputs used from StyleGAN are independent of location information and have a negative impact on natural location information learning because random noise is inserted in pixel units at intervals. This problem was even more problematic in the area of creating human faces. StyleGAN3 was announced to overcome this, but it did not completely solve the existing problems. If the angle of a human face is more than 30 degrees from the front, the restoration rate further decreases. In this article, we propose an advanced semantic segment encoder that accurately generates eyes, nose, and mouth even when the angle of a human face is rotated more than 60 degrees. We developed a face-angle analyzer to accurately measure the angle of a person's face. The proposed idea improved restoration performance by approximately 30% compared to existing encoders when the face is not straight ahead.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence is occupying all spheres of our daily lives: work, economics, culture, education, politics, and the key lies in harnessing its potential to our advantage. It is a phenomenon that poses new and complex challenges for higher education, especially the teaching role if we take into account the training of the professionals of the future. Open AI's chatbot, known worldwide as Chat GPT, still has a record 3.5 million users on its first day of "life". A year after its release, young people are using it every day at university, and we are curious to know how and what for. This is a moment in which the university should be oriented towards the production of sovereign and critical knowledge mediated by AI. What potential is there in the intersection between education and work from generative AI and why is its development and promotion essential? What competences and skills become crucial? And most of all, what students are we educating? Concerns that arise from the field of Communication in Argentina, taking as a case study a research project that is being carried out with Communication undergraduates and related careers.

AB  - As information exists in various modalities in real world, effective interaction and fusion among multimodal information plays a key role for the creation and perception of multimodal data in computer vision and deep learning research. With superb power in modeling the interaction among multimodal information, multimodal image synthesis and editing has become a hot research topic in recent years. Instead of providing explicit guidance for network training, multimodal guidance offers intuitive and flexible means for image synthesis and editing. On the other hand, this field is also facing several challenges in alignment of multimodal features, synthesis of high-resolution images, faithful evaluation metrics, etc. In this survey, we comprehensively contextualize the advance of the recent multimodal image synthesis and editing and formulate taxonomies according to data modalities and model types. We start with an introduction to different guidance modalities in image synthesis and editing, and then describe multimodal image synthesis and editing approaches extensively according to their model types. After that, we describe benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics as well as corresponding experimental results. Finally, we provide insights about the current research challenges and possible directions for future research.

AB  - This paper examines critical ethical considerations linked to making human resources management (HRM) decisions based on the potential capabilities (affordances) offered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI). We first provide a broad overview of the status quo surrounding the use of GAI in the HRM context. Then, we introduce the concept of "affordance" and explain how it provides a useful perspective for human resource (HR) managers to use when evaluating potential benefits and/or harm resulting from the implementation of a potential GAI-based capability to support HRM processes decisions. We discuss concrete examples of how GAI HRM affordances could be implemented in different HRM functions and the ethical questions that arise from their use. Finally, we present an ethics-based framework, the Two-Rule Method, along with ethics-specific recommendations to guide HR managers through the complex issues that arise because of the use of GAI-enabled HR tools.

TI  - Generative AI: An AI paradigm shift in the making?
T2  - AI MAGAZINE
LA  - English
AB  - It is sometimes difficult to evaluate progress in Generative AI, that is, image generation and large language models. This may be because they represent a paradigm shift in AI, and the traditional ways of developing, evaluating, understanding, and deploying AI systems no longer apply. Instead, we need to develop new such approaches, possibly by extending those currently in use in cognitive neuroscience and psychology. In this manner, a new AI paradigm can be created, providing a significant leap in AI research and practice.

AB  - This paper explores the challenges of Generative AI technologies to China's diplomatic engagement worldwide. First, it examines the discourse in China about the development of ChatGPT, by focusing on the treatment of the technology and the possible risks and opportunities regarding international affairs. Second, the article highlights four challenges: (1) the securitization of AI, where import/export controls, data access, and semiconductors open a new field of research; (2) the (techno-) socialism with Chinese characteristics and the response to the arrival of cutting-edge technologies from U.S. capital and their impact on the development of a local model; (3) the soft censorship: the development of a technology that responds in the "correct" way (i.e., in line with the ruling ideology) by discriminating the suitability of sources/data deemed correct and appropriate for the public sphere; (4) the impact on public diplomacy, as AI projects an aura of innovation and technological reputation. In summary, this paper contributes to the theoretical debate on the challenges posed by Generative IA technologies in the context of China's diplomatic practices.

AB  - Organoid models have provided a powerful platform for mechanistic investigations into fundamental biological processes involved in the development and function of organs. Despite the potential for image-based phenotypic quantification of organoids, their complex 3D structure, and the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of immunofluorescent staining present significant challenges. In this work, we developed a virtual painting system, PhaseFIT (phase-fluorescent image transformation) utilizing customized and morphologically rich 2.5D intestinal organoids, which generate virtual fluorescent images for phenotypic quantification via accessible and low-cost organoid phase images. This system is driven by a novel segmentation-informed deep generative model that specializes in segmenting overlap and proximity between objects. The model enables an annotation-free digital transformation from phase-contrast to multi-channel fluorescent images. The virtual painting results of nuclei, secretory cell markers, and stem cells demonstrate that PhaseFIT outperforms the existing deep learning-based stain transformation models by generating fine-grained visual content. We further validated the efficiency and accuracy of PhaseFIT to quantify the impacts of three compounds on crypt formation, cell population, and cell stemness. PhaseFIT is the first deep learning-enabled virtual painting system focused on live organoids, enabling large-scale, informative, and efficient organoid phenotypic quantification. PhaseFIT would enable the use of organoids in high-throughput drug screening applications.
   PhaseFIT is a cutting-edge, segmentation-informed generative AI which effortlessly transforms one dimensional phase contrast images into rich, multi-channel fluorescent visuals for rapid, annotation-free phenotypic quantification, setting a new standard for high content drug screening applications.

AB  - Engineered cementitious composite (ECC) has been intensively studied due to its excellent tensile performance. However, classical micro-mechanical design theory of ECC is qualitative and fails to give detailed ECC mixtures at specific tensile parameters. This study aims to develop a performance-based mixture design model to generate ECC mixtures using generative AI method. An experimental database consisting of 129 polyethylene fiber reinforced ECC (PE-ECC) records has been built. The database was used to train one invertible neural network model and two artificial neural network models. A series of PE-ECC mixtures were generated by the proposed model based on desired mechanical performance and sustainable requirements. Based on the experimental results, the developed model was proven to compose PE-ECC mixtures that satisfy the target requirements with a maximum deviation of less than 16%. The neural network-based model can be used in various application scenarios (e.g., low-cost ECC and low-carbon ECC), thus promoting the development of ECC materials in the area of research and engineering application.

AB  - The introduction of ChatGPT has fuelled a public debate on the appropriateness of using Generative AI (large language models; LLMs) in work, including a debate on how they might be used (and abused) by researchers. In the current work, we test whether delegating parts of the research process to LLMs leads people to distrust researchers and devalues their scientific work. Participants (N = 402) considered a researcher who delegates elements of the research process to a PhD student or LLM and rated three aspects of such delegation. Firstly, they rated whether it is morally appropriate to do so. Secondly, they judged whether-after deciding to delegate the research process-they would trust the scientist (that decided to delegate) to oversee future projects. Thirdly, they rated the expected accuracy and quality of the output from the delegated research process. Our results show that people judged delegating to an LLM as less morally acceptable than delegating to a human (d = -0.78). Delegation to an LLM also decreased trust to oversee future research projects (d = -0.80), and people thought the results would be less accurate and of lower quality (d = -0.85). We discuss how this devaluation might transfer into the underreporting of Generative AI use.

AB  - Motivation: After the recent introduction of ChatGPT, the rise of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has ignited discussions about its potential to disrupt employment and impact labor productivity. Our paper empirically examines the potential effects of GAI.
   Premise: Our paper showcases GAI's impact on employment and labor productivity in the United States.
   Approach: We investigate the 100 largest publicly traded U.S. companies. The key variable of GAI exposure is from Eisfeldt, Schubert, and Zhang (2023). Employment is measured by the number of employees or the number of employees scaled by total assets. Labor productivity is assessed using real sales per employee or operating income per employee. We employ a difference-in-differences methodology, comparing changes in firms with high GAI exposure to those with low GAI exposure, before and after the launch of ChatGPT.
   Results: Our findings indicate that the introduction of GAI has not had a negative impact on employment. Furthermore, GAI has created positive and statistically significant effects on labor productivity.
   Conclusion: We conclude that GAI has not decreased employment but has increased labor productivity. The impact of GAI extends beyond the business world. Our discovery highlights the revolutionary potential of GAI and encourages policy makers to utilize it to benefit and advance society.
   Consistency: Our research provides the latest empirical evidence on GAI's impact on employment and labor productivity. The findings suggest that GAI's adoption enhances labor productivity for businesses and creates employment stability. Our discovery has prevalent and profound influence on the present and future of our world.

AB  - While generative AI such as ChatGPT has important drawbacks, it can potentially unlock new types of learning and support - specially for English learners and students with disabilities - by facilitating teachers' Universal Design for Learning (UDL) efforts. As generative AI is quickly becoming an integral part of our lives (e.g., being incorporated into existing tools such as Google products), teachers will need to decide how they can use and benefit from this new technology. Our analysis of data collected during a summer teacher institute found that in Summer 2023 the majority of teachers had never used generative AI and were evenly split on whether it was a "friend" or "foe" in their teaching efforts. Overall, 43% of teachers reported, "ChatGPT and other generative AI will help make instruction more accessible for ALL learners," while 32% of teachers were "undecided" indicating an opportunity to improve teacher perceptions. In this article we discuss strategies for using generative AI for improving UDL to benefit ALL learners brainstormed by the teachers. Practical implications for multilingual learners are discussed.

AB  - ObjectivesThis paper aims to provide a tutorial for diabetologists and endocrinologists on using generative AI to analyze datasets. It is designed to be accessible to those new to generative AI or without programming experience.MethodsThe paper presents three examples using a real diabetes dataset. The examples demonstrate binary classification with the 'Group' variable, cross-validation analysis, and NT-proBNP regression.ResultsThe binary classification achieved a prediction accuracy of nearly 0.9. However, the NT-proBNP regression was not successful with this dataset. The calculated R-squared values indicate a poor fit between the predicted model and the raw data.ConclusionsThe unsuccessful NT-proBNP regression may be due to insufficient training data or the need for additional determinants. The dataset may be too small or new metrics may be required to accurately predict NT-proBNP regression values. It is crucial for users to verify the generated codes to ensure that they can achieve their desired objectives.

AB  - Background AI models have shown promise in performing many medical imaging tasks. However, our ability to explain what signals these models have learned is severely lacking. Explanations are needed in order to increase the trust of doctors in AI -based models, especially in domains where AI prediction capabilities surpass those of humans. Moreover, such explanations could enable novel scienti fi c discovery by uncovering signals in the data that aren ' t yet known to experts. Methods In this paper, we present a work fl ow for generating hypotheses to understand which visual signals in images are correlated with a classi fi cation model ' s predictions for a given task. This approach leverages an automatic visual explanation algorithm followed by interdisciplinary expert review. We propose the following 4 steps: (i) Train a classi fi er to perform a given task to assess whether the imagery indeed contains signals relevant to the task; (ii) Train a StyleGAN-based image generator with an architecture that enables guidance by the classi fi er ( " StylEx " ); (iii) Automatically detect, extract, and visualize the top visual attributes that the classi fi er is sensitive towards. For visualization, we independently modify each of these attributes to generate counterfactual visualizations for a set of images (i.e., what the image would look like with the attribute increased or decreased); (iv) Formulate hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms, to stimulate future research. Speci fi cally, present the discovered attributes and corresponding counterfactual visualizations to an interdisciplinary panel of experts so that hypotheses can account for social and structural determinants of health (e.g., whether the attributes correspond to known patho-physiological or socio-cultural phenomena, or could be novel discoveries). Findings To demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach, we present results on eight prediction tasks across three medical imaging modalities - retinal fundus photographs, external eye photographs, and chest radiographs. We showcase examples where many of the automatically-learned attributes clearly capture clinically known features (e.g., types of cataract, enlarged heart), and demonstrate automatically-learned confounders that arise from factors beyond physiological mechanisms (e.g., chest X-ray underexposure is correlated with the classi fi er predicting abnormality, and eye makeup is correlated with the classi fi er predicting low hemoglobin levels). We further show that our method reveals a number of physiologically plausible, previously-unknown attributes based on the literature (e.g., differences in the fundus associated with self-reported sex, which were previously unknown). Interpretation Our approach enables hypotheses generation via attribute visualizations and has the potential to enable researchers to better understand, improve their assessment, and extract new knowledge from AI -based models, as well as debug and design better datasets. Though not designed to infer causality, importantly, we highlight that attributes generated by our framework can capture phenomena beyond physiology or pathophysiology, re fl ecting the real world nature of healthcare delivery and socio-cultural factors, and hence interdisciplinary perspectives are critical in these investigations. Finally, we will release code to help researchers train their own StylEx models and analyze their predictive tasks of interest, and use the methodology presented in this paper for responsible interpretation of the revealed attributes.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a transcript of a dialogue among literacy educators and researchers on the impact of generative aritficial intelligence (AI) in the field. In the spring of 2023, a lively conversation emerged on the National Council of Research on Language and Literacy (NCRLL)'s listserv. Stephanie initiated the conversation by sharing an op-ed she wrote for Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the rise of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, moving beyond the general public's concerns about student cheating and robot takeovers. NCRLL then convened a webinar of eight leading scholars in writing and literacies development, inspired by that listerv conversation and an organizational interest in promoting intergenerational collaboration among literacy scholars.Design/methodology/approach - As former doctoral students of two of the panel participants, webinar facilitators Grace and Victoria positioned themselves primarily as learners about this topic and gathered questions from colleagues, P-16 practitioners and those outside the field of education to assess the concerns and wonderings that ChatGPT and generative AI have raised. The following webinar conversation was recorded on two different days due to scheduling conflicts. It has been merged and edited into one dialogue for coherence and convergence.Findings - Panel participants raise a host of questions and issues that go beyond topics of ethics, morality and basic writing instruction. Furthermore, in dialogue with one another, they describe possibilities for meaningful pedagogy and critical literacy to ensure that generative AI is used for a socially just future for students. While the discussion addressed matters of pedagogy, definitions of literacy and the purpose of (literacy) education, other themes included a critique of capitalism; an interrogation of the systems of power and oppression involved in using generative AI; and the philosophical, ontological, ethical and practical life questions about being human.Originality/value - This paper provides a glimpse into one of the first panel conversations about ChatGPT and generative AI in the field of literacy. Not only are the panel members respected scholars in the field, they are also former doctoral students and advisors of one another, thus positioning all involved as both learners and teachers of this new technology.

TI  - Hybrid Ethics for Generative AI: Some Philosophical Inquiries on GANs
T2  - HUMANA MENTE-JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Until now, the mass spread of fake news and its negative consequences have implied mainly textual content towards a loss of citizens' trust in institutions. Recently, a new type of machine learning framework has arisen, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - a class of deep neural network models capable of creating multimedia content (photos, videos, audio) that simulate accurate content with extreme precision. While there are several areas of worthwhile application of GANs - e.g., in the field of audio-visual production, human -computer interactions, satire, and artistic creativity - their deceptive uses, at least as currently foreseeable, are just as numerous and worrying. The main concern is linked to the so-called "deepfakes", fake images or videos that simulate real events with extreme precision. When trained on a human face, GANs can make the face assume hyper -realistic movements, expressions and (verbal and non-verbal) communication abilities. This technology poses an urgent threat to the governance of democratic processes concerning the production of public opinions and political discourses, with significant potential for reality -altering and disinformation. After a short introduction oftheir current technical state-of-the-art, in this paper, we want to enquire about the GANs` socio-technical system alongside different and intertwined philosophical accounts. Firstly, we will argue about the conditions that make perceived GANs-generated content trustworthy, arguing also about the general effects GANs might have on the perceived trustworthiness of individuals. Thereafter, we will discuss about the inadequacy to approach GANs only as perception -altering technology. Against this backdrop, we will propose a theoretical turn that considers the human -machine relationships of trustworthiness as elements of broader hybrid socio-technical systems. This turn comes up with political repercussions that we will discuss in the last part of the paper.

AB  - In this study, an online contextualized educational game was designed to provide interactive simulated dialogues using generative AI scaffolding (using ChatPDF) in a contextualized game as scaffolding for immediate feedback, where learners can access guides and explore knowledge. This study analyzed learners' behaviors while performing AI prompting in the interactive scaffolding, as well as learners' psychological responses. A total of 59 students participated in this study. The results of the study showed that learners had significantly high flow and low activity anxiety in the game tasks, while game feedback and scaffolding usefulness had significant effects on learning aids. The generative AI instant feedback interactive scaffolding had a certain high percentage of direct answers or indirect suggestions, which is suitable for interactive scaffolding.

AB  - Matching the language or content of a message to the psychological profile of its recipient (known as "personalized persuasion") is widely considered to be one of the most effective messaging strategies. We demonstrate that the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, could accelerate this influence by making personalized persuasion scalable. Across four studies (consisting of seven sub-studies; total N = 1788), we show that personalized messages crafted by ChatGPT exhibit significantly more influence than non-personalized messages. This was true across different domains of persuasion (e.g., marketing of consumer products, political appeals for climate action), psychological profiles (e.g., personality traits, political ideology, moral foundations), and when only providing the LLM with a single, short prompt naming or describing the targeted psychological dimension. Thus, our findings are among the first to demonstrate the potential for LLMs to automate, and thereby scale, the use of personalized persuasion in ways that enhance its effectiveness and efficiency. We discuss the implications for researchers, practitioners, and the general public.

AB  - A leading critic of the disruptive force of technology in education, Bernard Stiegler saw the counter-effects of artificial intelligence in undermining human agency, autonomy and individuality, rendering the role of education ever more critical. Stiegler believes that our goal is not to abandon technology but to focus our attention on its power and direction in a hypercapitalist economy. While he did not foresee the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its rapid acceleration raises important issues for his notion of digital writing as a pharmakon. In this essay, we examine Stiegler's view on intelligence, digital writing, technological memory, and neuropower, focusing specifically on his Shanghai lecture and Nanjing Lectures. We compare Stiegler with Catherine Malabou, who examines the nature of intelligence primarily through the lens of neuroscience. We argue that Malabou's view of neuroplasticity in human and artificial brains, and her critique of techno-narcissism in the control over technology, add an important dimension to Stiegler's political critique of education. Finally, we examine how best to construe AI as part of a hyper-materialist epistemology that Stiegler espouses in the conclusion of his Nanjing Lectures, to bring about neganthropic knowledge through a therapeutics of care.

AB  - We suggest the implementation of the Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) framework, originally designed for life sciences, to the domain of generative AI, with a specific focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). With its demonstrated advantages and drawbacks in biological research, we believe the DURC criteria can be effectively redefined for LLMs, potentially contributing to improved AI governance. Acknowledging the balance that must be struck when employing the DURC framework, we highlight its crucial political role in enhancing societal awareness of the impact of generative AI. As a final point, we offer a series of specific recommendations for applying the DURC approach to LLM research.

AB  - This paper examines the role of Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in penetration testing exploring the benefits, challenges, and risks associated with cyber security applications. Through the use of generative artificial intelligence, penetration testing becomes more creative, test environments are customised, and continuous learning and adaptation is achieved. We examined how GenAI (ChatGPT 3.5) helps penetration testers with options and suggestions during the five stages of penetration testing. The effectiveness of the GenAI tool was tested using a publicly available vulnerable machine from VulnHub. It was amazing how quickly they responded at each stage and provided better pentesting report. In this article, we discuss potential risks, unintended consequences, and uncontrolled AI development associated with pentesting.

AB  - The potential impact of generative AI across politics, governance and war is enormous, and is the subject of considerable speculation informed by few hard facts. Yet it is possible to identify some major challenges. They include threats to democracies by privately controlled models that gain tremendous power to shape discourse and affect democratic deliberation; enhanced surveillance and propaganda dissemination by authoritarian regimes; new capacities for criminal and terrorist actors to carry out cyber attacks and related disruptions; and transformed war planning and military operations reflecting the accelerated dehumanisation of lethal force. While new innovations historically require time to take root, generative AI is likely to be adopted swiftly. Stakeholders must formulate pragmatic approaches to manage oncoming risks.

AB  - This article examines the intricate relationship between humans and text-to-image generative models (generative artificial intelligence/genAI) in the realm of art. The article frames that relationship in the theory of mediated action-a well-established theory that conceptualizes how tools shape human thoughts and actions. The article describes genAI systems as learning, cocreating, and communicating, multimodally capable hybrid systems that distill and rely on the wisdom and creativity of massive crowds of people and can sometimes surpass them. Those systems elude the theoretical description of the role of tools and locus of control in mediated action. The article asks how well the theory can accommodate both the transformative potential of genAI tools in creative fields and art, and the ethics of the emergent social dynamics it generates. The article concludes by discussing the fundamental changes and broader implications that genAI brings to the realm of mediated action and, ultimately, to the very fabric of our daily lives.

AB  - In this article, we report results of an experimental study investigating the use of ChatGPT in the design of an HRD intervention. Our goal was to identify the benefits and drawbacks of using this technology in HRD practice. The theoretical framework for the study was provided by the Activity Theory, an often used approach in Human-Computer Interaction research. The study participants were HRD doctoral students from two large public universities in the USA. The participants used ChatGPT in developing an HRD intervention plan, based on a supplied organisational scenario. Data for the analysis included the intervention plans, prompts used by participants, outputs received from ChatGPT, and participants' responses to open-ended questions. The study revealed varied participant experiences with ChatGPT, including differences in time investment and interaction rules. Among key findings were the tendency to interact with ChatGPT as if it were a human consultant, and steps to establish division of labour between the tool and the human agent. ChatGPT was valued for its usefulness in initial planning and brainstorming ideas for HRD interventions, yet its limitations were apparent in generic responses and lack of contextual understanding. Across all participants, the crucial role of human expertise in refining ChatGPT's output was consistently highlighted.

AB  - This article situates the potential for intellectual work to be renewed through an enriched engagement with the relationship between indigenous protocols and artificial intelligence (AI). It situates this through a dialectical storytelling of the contradictions that emerge from the relationships between humans and capitalist technologies, played out within higher education. It argues that these have ramifications for our conceptions of AI, and its ways of knowing, doing and being within wider ecosystems. In thinking about how technology reinforces social production inside capitalist institutions like universities, the article seeks to refocus our storytelling around mass intellectuality and generative possibilities for transcending alienating social relations. In so doing, the focus shifts to the potential for weaving new protocols, from existing material and historical experiences of technology, which unfold structurally, culturally and practically within communities. At the heart of this lies the question, what does it mean to live? In a world described against polycrisis, is it possible to tell new social science fictions, as departures towards a new mode of higher learning and intellectual work that seeks to negate, abolish and transcend the world as-is?

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of generative deep learning models have proliferated as a tool to facilitate or exhibit creativity across various design fields. When it comes to fashion design, existing applications of AI have more heavily addressed general fashion design elements, such as style, silhouette, colour, and pattern, and paid less attention to the underlying textile attributes. To address this gap, this study explores the effects of applying a generative deep learning model specifically towards the textile component of the fashion design process, by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to generate new images of knitted textile designs, which were then assessed based on their aesthetic quality in a qualitative survey with over 200 respondents. The results suggest that the generative deep learning (GAN) based method has the ability to produce new textile designs with creative qualities and practical utility that facilitate the fashion design process.

AB  - center dot Three significant lawsuits concerning generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) were filed in the USA, starting the first wave of lawsuits against AI: (i) coders filed claims for the alleged use of their codes by OpenAI's CoPilot, (ii) visual artists filed claims against companies using Stable Diffusion and (iii) Getty Images filed claims against Stability AI, which uses Stable Diffusion. Following the lead of these lawsuits, copyright owners of literary works filed four other lawsuits against OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet (Google)'s large language models. All of these lawsuits are pending at the time of writing.
   center dot Among other things, plaintiffs filed claims challenging generative AI's lack of attribution to copyright owners of in-copyright works in its training data. As US copyright law does not protect moral rights strongly, a federal rule granting a right of attribution to all copyright owners does not exist. Yet, there are some provisions providing quasi-protection. Section 1202 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is one of them and protects copyright owners against removal/modification of the Copyright Management Information in connection with their works.
   center dot This article lays down the limitations of moral rights protection in the USA and demonstrates the difficulties faced by the plaintiffs of the pending lawsuits. The limitations of Section 1202 DMCA are explained to demonstrate its difference from a classic moral right of attribution. The outcomes of these lawsuits will be significant in building case law on generative AI for the first time in the USA. This article evaluates the benefits and disadvantages of courts' possible acceptance of plaintiffs' claims regarding attribution.

AB  - Human resource management (HRM) professionals are often overworked, and their jobs are increasingly complex. Therefore, many suffer from job burnout, and only some can allocate the necessary time to strategic issues. We show how generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, can be a helpful HRM assistant for both strategic and operational tasks. But, for this to happen, we demonstrate the need to create valuable prompts that result in specific, helpful, and actionable HRM recommendations. Accordingly, we provide eight guidelines for creating high-quality and effective prompts and illustrate their usefulness in general across eight critical HRM domains and in more depth in the particular areas of workforce diversity and strategic HRM. We also provide recommendations and demonstrate how to implement a critical verification process to check on ChatGPT's suggestions. We conclude with a list of "dos and don'ts" and that when used by sufficiently trained HRM professionals, it is a very useful tool because it helps complete tasks faster, hopefully reducing their job burnout and allowing them to allocate more time to strategic and long-term issues. In turn, these benefits will likely result in helping achieve the as-of-yet-unrealized aspiration of "having a seat at the table."

AB  - As a specific category of artificial intelligence (AI), generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) generates new content that resembles what humans create. The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems. Finally, we list design considerations for training and deploying GenAI systems at scale and point out future research directions.

AB  - Fashion design usually requires multiple designers to discuss and collaborate to complete a set of fashion designs, and the efficiency of the sketching process is another challenge for personalized design. In this paper, we introduce a fashion design system, CrossGAI, that can support multiple designers to collaborate on different devices and provide AI-enhanced sketching assistance. Based on the design requirements analysis acquired from the formative study of designers, we develop the system framework of CrossGAI implemented by the user-side web-based cross-device design platform working along with the server-side AI-integrated backend system. The CrossGAI system can be agilely deployed in LAN networks which protects the privacy and security of user data. To further improve both the efficiency and the quality of the sketch process, we devised and exploited generative AI modules, including a sketch retrieval module to retrieve sketches according to stroke or sketch drawn, a sketch generation module enabling the generation of fashion sketches consistent with the designer's unique aesthetic, and an image synthesis module that could achieve sketch-to-image synthesis in accordance with the reference image's style. To optimise the computation offloading when multiple user processes are handled in LAN networks, Lyapunov algorithm with DNN actor is utilized to dynamically optimize the network bandwidth of different clients based on their access history to the application and reduce network latency. The performance of our modules is verified through a series of evaluations under LAN environment, which prove that our CrossGAI system owns competitive ability in AIGC-aided designing. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis on user experience and work quality demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of CrossGAI system in design work.

AB  - The distribution of material phases is crucial to determine the composite's mechanical property. While the full structure-mechanics relationship of highly ordered material distributions can be studied with finite number of cases, this relationship is difficult to be revealed for complex irregular distributions, preventing design of such material structures to meet certain mechanical requirements. The noticeable developments of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in material design enables to detect the hidden structure-mechanics correlations which is essential for designing composite of complex structures. It is intriguing how these tools can assist composite design. Here, we focus on the rapid generation of bicontinuous composite structures together with the stress distribution in loading. We find that generative AI, enabled through fine-tuned Low Rank Adaptation models, can be trained with a few inputs to generate both synthetic composite structures and the corresponding von Mises stress distribution. The results show that this technique is convenient in generating massive composites designs with useful mechanical information that dictate stiffness, fracture and robustness of the material with one model, and such has to be done by several different experimental or simulation tests. This research offers valuable insights for the improvement of composite design with the goal of expanding the design space and automatic screening of composite designs for improved mechanical functions.

AB  - Chatbots are now able to engage in sophisticated conversations with consumers. Due to the "black box" nature of the algorithms, it is impossible to predict in advance how these conversations will unfold. Behavioral research provides little insight into potential safety issues emerging from the current rapid deployment of this technology at scale. We begin to address this urgent question by focusing on the context of mental health and "companion AI": Applications designed to provide consumers with synthetic interaction partners. Studies 1a and 1b present field evidence: Actual consumer interactions with two different companion AIs. Study 2 reports an extensive performance test of several commercially available companion AIs. Study 3 is an experiment testing consumer reaction to risky and unhelpful chatbot responses. The findings show that (1) mental health crises are apparent in a nonnegligible minority of conversations with users; (2) companion AIs are often unable to recognize, and respond appropriately to, signs of distress; and (3) consumers display negative reactions to unhelpful and risky chatbot responses, highlighting emerging reputational risks for generative AI companies.

Dr. Beghetto's work highlights a shift from fearing failure to embracing possibility thinking, advocating for a mindset that views creativity as a dynamic interplay of potential and adaptability. His recent work with GenAI tools illustrates their role as catalysts for possibility thinking, pushing the boundaries towards future-oriented thought and innovation. GenAI can function in multiple ways-including as a reflection of human intellect and values, and as a collaborative partner that enriches human creativity with its unpredictability and generative capabilities. We emphasize the importance of direct, critical, and creative engagement with GenAI in educational settings, cautioning against its passive or uncritical use, and advocating for a balanced approach that leverages its strengths while remaining aware of its limitations. Sharing several possibility thinking tools he has created, Dr. Beghetto offers readers a nuanced perspective on the role of GenAI in education and creativity, advocating for a future where these tools are used responsibly and creatively to unlock new possibilities and enhance human potential.

TI  - Generative AI for Economic Research: Use Cases and Implications for Economists†
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE
LA  - English
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize research. I analyze how large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can assist economists by describing dozens of use cases in six areas: ideation and feedback, writing, back-ground research, data analysis, coding, and mathematical derivations. I provide gen-eral instructions and demonstrate specific examples of how to take advantage of each of these, classifying the LLM capabilities from experimental to highly useful. I argue that economists can reap significant productivity gains by taking advantage of gener-ative AI to automate micro-tasks. Moreover, these gains will grow as the performance of AI systems continues to improve. I also speculate on the longer-term implications of AI-powered cognitive automation for economic research. The online resources asso-ciated with this paper explain how to get started and will provide regular updates on the latest capabilities of generative AI in economics. (JEL A11, C45, D83, I23, O33)

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW & PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - The rise of Generative AI has raised many questions from the perspective of copyright. From the lens of copyright and database rights, issues revolve not only around the authorship of AI-generated outputs, but also the very process that leads to the generation of these outputs, namely the process of text and data mining (TDM). Does unauthorized TDM process infringe the economic rights of the rightholders? How does the TDM-debate transform and transmute in the age of Generative AI? Generative AI tools create works that substitute the content creators whose very work that they learn from, and successively improvise themselves with every iteration. Generative AI, thus, also presents larger policy question as they substitute the romanticized human author that sits at the centre of copyright. In addition, as Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can now also crawl the web, questions thus transcend the frontiers of copyright, and touch upon innovation and competition in the market for web browsers. This research article contemplates on the foregoing issues, and makes some recommendations to create a balanced framework, whereby incentives to innovate are preserved, and the interests of the human author are suitably safeguarded in the age of TDM and Generative AI.

AB  - The advent and growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds the potential to revolutionise AI applications in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice, which traditionally relied on discriminative AI algorithms. Generative AI models mark a significant shift from the previously prevailing paradigm through their ability to generate seemingly new realistic data and analyse and integrate a vast amount of unstructured content from different data formats. This potential extends beyond reshaping conventional practices, like risk assessment, diagnostic support, and treatment and rehabilitation plans, to creating new opportunities in previously underexplored areas, such as training and education. This paper examines the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence on AI applications in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice. First, it introduces generative AI and its prevalent models. Following this, it reviews the current applications of discriminative AI in forensic psychiatry. Subsequently, it presents a thorough exploration of the potential of generative AI to transform established practices and introduce novel applications through multimodal generative models, data generation and data augmentation. Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview of ethical and legal issues associated with deploying generative AI models, focusing on their impact on individuals as well as their broader societal implications. In conclusion, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse concerning the dynamic challenges of generative AI applications in forensic contexts, highlighting potential opportunities, risks, and challenges. It advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and emphasises the necessity for thorough, responsible evaluations of generative AI models before widespread adoption into domains where decisions with substantial life-altering consequences are routinely made.

The purpose of this study was to explore and compare feedback and data-based instructional suggestions from teachers and those generated by different AI tools. Essays from students with and without disabilities who struggled with writing and needed a technology-based writing intervention were analyzed. The essays were imported into two versions of ChatGPT using four different prompts, whereby eight sets of responses were generated. Inductive thematic analysis was used to explore the data sets. Findings indicated: (a) differences in responses between ChatGPT versions and prompts, (b) AI feedback on student writing did not reflect provided student characteristics (e.g., grade level or needs; disability; ELL status), and (c) ChatGPT's responses to the essays aligned with teachers' identified areas of needs and instructional decisions to some degree. Suggestions for increasing educator engagement with AI to enhance teaching writing is discussed.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to analyse the likely implications of Generative AI (GAI) on various aspects of business and the economy. Amid the rapid growth and maturing of Generative AI technologies such as Large Language Models (like ChatGPT by OpenAI) a rapid growth of both immediate and potential applications can be seen. The implications for the economy and industries of this technological shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of adoption that GAI might achieve-from useful analytical tool, invaluable assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium service opportunities are foreseen. For instance, general purpose models may provide quality service-such as copywriting-to overserved customers leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative content. On the other hand highly specialized models-specifically trained in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide a premium service over that provided by human experts. It is expected that some jobs will be replaced by new AI applications. However, new workplaces will emerge. Not only the obvious expert-level data scientist roles but also low grade, "model supervisors"-people training the models, assessing the quality of responses given and handling escalations. Lastly new cybercrime risks emerging from the rise of GAI are discussed.

KW  - artificial intelligence
KW  - health care
AB  - The increasing interest in the potential applications of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models like ChatGPT in health care has prompted numerous studies to explore its performance in various medical contexts. However, evaluating ChatGPT poses unique challenges due to the inherent randomness in its responses. Unlike traditional AI models, ChatGPT generates different responses for the same input, making it imperative to assess its stability through repetition. This commentary highlights the importance of including repetition in the evaluation of ChatGPT to ensure the reliability of conclusions drawn from its performance. Similar to biological experiments, which often require multiple repetitions for validity, we argue that assessing generative AI models like ChatGPT demands a similar approach. Failure to acknowledge the impact of repetition can lead to biased conclusions and undermine the credibility of research findings. We urge researchers to incorporate appropriate repetition in their studies from the outset and transparently report their methods to enhance the robustness and reproducibility of findings in this rapidly evolving field.

KW  - risk deduction
AB  - In the current realms of scientific research and commercial applications, the risk inference of regulatory violations by publicly listed enterprises has attracted considerable attention. However, there are some problems in the existing research on the deduction and prediction of violation risk of listed enterprises, such as the lack of analysis of the causal logic association between violation events, the low interpretability and effectiveness of the deduction and the lack of training data. To solve these problems, we propose a framework for enterprise violation risk deduction based on generative AI and event evolution graphs. First, the generative AI technology was used to generate a new text summary of the lengthy and complex enterprise violation announcement to realize a concise overview of the violation matters. Second, by fine-tuning the generative AI model, an event entity and causality extraction framework based on automated data augmentation are proposed, and the UIE (Unified Structure Generation for Universal Information Extraction) event entity extraction model is used to create the event entity extraction for listed enterprises 'violations. Then, a causality extraction model CDDP-GAT (Event Causality Extraction Based on Chinese Dictionary and Dependency Parsing of GAT) is proposed. This model aims to identify and analyse the causal links between corporate breaches, thereby deepening the understanding of the event logic. Then, the merger of similar events was realized, and the causal correlation weights between enterprise violation-related events were evaluated. Finally, the listed enterprise's violation risk event evolution graph was constructed, and the enterprise violation risk deduction was carried out to form an expert system of financial violations. The deduction results show that the method can effectively reveal signs of enterprise violations and adverse consequences.

TI  - VarChat: the generative AI assistant for the interpretation of human genomic variations
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Motivation In the modern era of genomic research, the scientific community is witnessing an explosive growth in the volume of published findings. While this abundance of data offers invaluable insights, it also places a pressing responsibility on genetic professionals and researchers to stay informed about the latest findings and their clinical significance. Genomic variant interpretation is currently facing a challenge in identifying the most up-to-date and relevant scientific papers, while also extracting meaningful information to accelerate the process from clinical assessment to reporting. Computer-aided literature search and summarization can play a pivotal role in this context. By synthesizing complex genomic findings into concise, interpretable summaries, this approach facilitates the translation of extensive genomic datasets into clinically relevant insights.Results To bridge this gap, we present VarChat (varchat.engenome.com), an innovative tool based on generative AI, developed to find and summarize the fragmented scientific literature associated with genomic variants into brief yet informative texts. VarChat provides users with a concise description of specific genetic variants, detailing their impact on related proteins and possible effects on human health. In addition, VarChat offers direct links to related scientific trustable sources, and encourages deeper research.Availability and implementation varchat.engenome.com.

KW  - LIBRARY
AB  - The rise of pan-resistant bacteria is creating an urgent need for structurally novel antibiotics. Artificial intelligence methods can discover new antibiotics, but existing methods have notable limitations. Property prediction models, which evaluate molecules one-by-one for a given property, scale poorly to large chemical spaces. Generative models, which directly design molecules, rapidly explore vast chemical spaces but generate molecules that are challenging to synthesize. Here we introduce SyntheMol, a generative model that designs new compounds, which are easy to synthesize, from a chemical space of nearly 30 billion molecules. We apply SyntheMol to design molecules that inhibit the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, a burdensome Gram-negative bacterial pathogen. We synthesize 58 generated molecules and experimentally validate them, with six structurally novel molecules demonstrating antibacterial activity against A. baumannii and several other phylogenetically diverse bacterial pathogens. This demonstrates the potential of generative artificial intelligence to design structurally novel, synthesizable and effective small-molecule antibiotic candidates from vast chemical spaces, with empirical validation.
   AI methods can discover new antibiotics but existing methods have limitations. Swanson et al. develop a generative AI model that learns to design molecules that are easy to synthesize. The authors apply the model to design and validate novel antibiotics against the bacterial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.

AB  - Generative AI products such as ChatGPT have changed the way people seek and obtain information. Users may gradually switch from search engines to generative AI for information seeking. This may lead to their defection from search services. Based on the push-pull-mooring (PPM) model, this research examined user switch intention from search engines to generative AI. The results indicated that low information-task fit and information overload lead to user dissatisfaction, whereas AI generated content (AIGC) information quality and perceived interactivity affect perceived value. Dissatisfaction, perceived value, and social influence determine user switch intention. The fsQCA identified three configurations leading to switch intention. The results suggest that search service providers need to enhance information-task fit and reduce information overload in order to retain users and achieve a sustainable development.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly expanding field that aims to develop machines capable of performing tasks that were previously considered unique to humans, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The recent release of several tools based on AI (e.g. ChatGPT) has sparked debates on the potential of this technology and garnered widespread attention in the mainstream media.Using a socio-psychological approach, in three studies (total N = 410), we demonstrate that when faced with Generative AI's ability to reproduce the complexity of human cognitive capabilities, participants reported significantly higher negative emotions than those in the control group. In turn, negative emotions elicited by a specific type of AI (e.g. generative AI) were associated to the perception of threat extended to AI technologies as a whole, understood as a threat to various aspects of human life, including jobs, resources, identity, uniqueness, and value.Our findings emphasise the importance of considering emotional and societal impacts when developing and deploying advanced AI technologies and implementing responsible guidelines to minimise adverse effects. As AI technology advances, addressing public concerns and regulating its usage is crucial for the benefit of society. To achieve this goal, collaboration between experts, policymakers, and the public is necessary.

AB  - Semantic communication (SemCom), a pioneering paradigm that places emphasis on conveying the meaning of information, faces challenges in constructing background knowledge to drive precise reasoning of semantic coding models. Fortunately, the recent emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology is promising to create high-quality content that can be harnessed to assist knowledge construction in SemCom, enhancing the reasoning ability of semantic coding models. In this letter, we propose a GAI-assisted SemCom framework, named Gen-SC, where sufficient samples for training SemCom transceivers are generated using GAI as per user contextual information. In addition, to guide the GAI model in producing contextually relevant content, a discriminator is incorporated into Gen-SC to measure the disparity between generated samples and actual samples. The simulation results demonstrate that the Gen-SC achieves higher semantic accuracy, especially when the original training samples are insufficient, in contrast to traditional SemCom without knowledge enhancement.

AB  - In the vehicular mixed reality (MR) Metaverse, the discrepancy between physical and virtual entities can be overcome by fusing the physical and virtual environments with multi-dimensional communications in autonomous driving systems. Assisted by digital twin (DT) technologies, connected autonomous vehicles (AVs), roadside units (RSUs), and virtual simulators can maintain the vehicular MR Metaverse via simulations for sharing data and making driving decisions collaboratively. However, it is challenging and costly to enable large-scale traffic and driving simulation via realistic data collection and fusion from the physical world for online prediction and offline training in autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose an autonomous driving architecture, where generative AI is leveraged to synthesize unlimited conditioned traffic and driving data via simulations for improving driving safety and traffic control efficiency. First, we propose a multi-task DT offloading model for the reliable execution of heterogeneous DT tasks with different requirements at RSUs. Then, based on the preferences of AV's DTs and real-world data, virtual simulators can synthesize unlimited conditioned driving and traffic datasets for improved robustness. Finally, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to provide fine-grained incentives for RSUs on providing resources for autonomous driving. The property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism and architecture are strategy-proof and effective.

AB  - Enzymes, as paramount protein catalysts, occupy a central role in fostering remarkable progress across numerous fields. However, the intricacy of sequence-function relationships continues to obscure our grasp of enzyme behaviors and curtails our capabilities in rational enzyme engineering. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), known for its proficiency in handling intricate data distributions, holds the potential to offer novel perspectives in enzyme research. Generative models could discern elusive patterns within the vast sequence space and uncover new functional enzyme sequences. This review highlights the recent advancements in employing generative AI for enzyme sequence analysis. We delve into the impact of generative AI in predicting mutation effects on enzyme fitness, catalytic activity and stability, rationalizing the laboratory evolution of de novo enzymes, and decoding protein sequence semantics and their application in enzyme engineering. Notably, the prediction of catalytic activity and stability of enzymes using natural protein sequences serves as a vital link, indicating how enzyme catalysis shapes enzyme evolution. Overall, we foresee that the integration of generative AI into enzyme studies will remarkably enhance our knowledge of enzymes and expedite the creation of superior biocatalysts.
   This Review underscores the latest advances in applying generative AI to the analysis of enzyme sequences, which has deepened our insight into enzyme evolution and catalysis, thereby advancing enzyme engineering.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a significant advancement in brain imaging techniques that offer a non-invasive approach to mapping the structure and function of the brain. Concurrently, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced substantial growth, involving using existing data to create new content with a similar underlying pattern to real-world data. The integration of these two domains, generative AI in neuroimaging, presents a promising avenue for exploring various fields of brain imaging and brain network computing, particularly in the areas of extracting spatiotemporal brain features and reconstructing the topological connectivity of brain networks. Therefore, this study reviewed the advanced models, tasks, challenges, and prospects of brain imaging and brain network computing techniques and intends to provide a comprehensive picture of current generative AI techniques in brain imaging. This review is focused on novel methodological approaches and applications of related new methods. It discussed fundamental theories and algorithms of four classic generative models and provided a systematic survey and categorization of tasks, including co-registration, super-resolution, enhancement, classification, segmentation, cross-modality, brain network analysis, and brain decoding. This paper also highlighted the challenges and future directions of the latest work with the expectation that future research can be beneficial.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have received great attention from researchers, the media, and the public. They are gladly and frequently used for text production by many people. These tools have undeniable strengths but also weaknesses that must be addressed. In this squib we ask to what extent these tools can be employed by users for individual learning as well as for knowledge construction to spark a collective endeavor of developing new insights. We take a social, collective notion of knowledge as a basis and argue that users need to establish a dialog that goes beyond knowledge telling (simply writing what one knows) and stimulates knowledge transformation (converting knowledge into complex relational argumentation structures). Generative AI tools do not have any conceptual knowledge or conscious understanding, as they only use word transitions and rely on probabilities of word classes. We suggest, however, that argumentative dialogs among humans and AI tools can be achieved with appropriate prompts, where emergent processes of joint knowledge construction can take place. Based on this assumption, we inquire into the human and into the AI parts of communication and text production. For our line of argument, we borrow from research on individual and collaborative writing, group cognition, and the co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. We outline future CSCL research paths that might take the human-AI co-construction of knowledge into account in terms of terminology, theory, and methodology.

AB  - The application of machine learning (ML) to operational data is becoming increasingly important with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI). We propose a model where incumbents have an initial advantage in ML technology and access to (historical) operational data. We show that the increased application of ML for operational data raises entrepreneurial barriers that make the creative destruction process less destructive (less business stealing) if entrepreneurs have only limited access to the incumbent's data. However, this situation induces entrepreneurs to take on more risk and to be more creative. Policies making data generally available may therefore be suboptimal. A complementary policy is one that supports entrepreneurs' access to ML, such as open source initiatives, since doing so would stimulate creative entrepreneurship.
   Why generative AI and big data may make the creative destruction process not only more creative but also less destructive. We show that entrepreneurs should consider that challenging incumbents in the era of ML and big data will be more difficult since incumbents' use of ML for proprietary data makes them more formidable competitors. This fact implies that entrepreneurs need to become riskier and more creative in the future to find a competitive edge. They may therefore seek support from venture capital to become more novel in their ventures. Data protection and privacy issues became a flashpoint in the media due in part to the high-profile exposure of Facebook users' data to Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and 2017. The rapidly expanding adoption of generative AI is seen as a risk of locking in the market dominance of large incumbent technology firms. Partially in response to these events, government regulators have instituted tighter rules on data protection. The results derived in this paper suggest that a complementary policy might be to support entrepreneurs' access to and knowledge of ML technology since doing so would stimulate creative entrepreneurship.

AB  - The exploration of transition state (TS) geometries is crucial for elucidating chemical reaction mechanisms and modeling their kinetics. Recently, machine learning (ML) models have shown remarkable performance for prediction of TS geometries. However, they require 3D conformations of reactants and products often with their appropriate orientations as input, which demands substantial efforts and computational cost. Here, we propose a generative approach based on the stochastic diffusion method, namely TSDiff, for prediction of TS geometries just from 2D molecular graphs. TSDiff outperforms the existing ML models with 3D geometries in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it enables to sample various TS conformations, because it learns the distribution of TS geometries for diverse reactions in training. Thus, TSDiff finds more favorable reaction pathways with lower barrier heights than those in the reference database. These results demonstrate that TSDiff shows promising potential for an efficient and reliable TS exploration.

AB  - The use of AI-based solutions is currently discussed in relation to various industries. The proliferation of tools based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including the emergence of ChatGPT, has resulted in testing as a first step and implementations in further areas of business life, including marketing, as a second step. Still only a few studies have analyzed and evaluated specific solutions for different areas of marketing, including advert design. In order to fill this gap, areas where GAI and ChatGPT are used during the various stages of creating a digital advertising campaign have been identified. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of GAI and ChatGPT on theory and practice on different stages of the digital advertising campaign building process. This objective is followed by a research question: how can marketers use GAI and ChatGPT to create an effective digital advertising campaign? The process of building a digital advertising campaign should be considered and analyzed in terms of the impact of using GAI and ChatGPT technology and, at the same time, the role played by marketers at each stage and their contribution to this process in collaboration with GAI-based tools. This article is intended as a preliminary exploration of the impact of using GAI and ChatGPT on the digital marketing campaign building process. Therefore, the methodology applied includes critical literature analysis, secondary data analysis and individual in depth interview (IDI) with an expert (CEO of a advertising agency). This represents a first step in the study, to be followed by in-depth empirical research (qualitative as well as quantitative) to verify and develop the conclusions drawn. The article analyses the impact of using generative AI and ChatGPT on the process of creating an advertising campaign in digital media from a theoretical and practical point of view. Theoretical and managerial implications are also presented.

KW  - BENCHMARK
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence is set to revolutionize healthcare delivery by transforming traditional patient care into a more personalized, efficient, and proactive process. Chatbots, serving as interactive conversational models, will probably drive this patient-centered transformation in healthcare. Through the provision of various services, including diagnosis, personalized lifestyle recommendations, dynamic scheduling of follow-ups, and mental health support, the objective is to substantially augment patient health outcomes, all the while mitigating the workload burden on healthcare providers. The life-critical nature of healthcare applications necessitates establishing a unified and comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for conversational models. Existing evaluation metrics proposed for various generic large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a lack of comprehension regarding medical and health concepts and their significance in promoting patients' well-being. Moreover, these metrics neglect pivotal user-centered aspects, including trust-building, ethics, personalization, empathy, user comprehension, and emotional support. The purpose of this paper is to explore state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluation metrics that are specifically applicable to the assessment of interactive conversational models in healthcare. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics designed to thoroughly assess the performance of healthcare chatbots from an end-user perspective. These metrics encompass an evaluation of language processing abilities, impact on real-world clinical tasks, and effectiveness in user-interactive conversations. Finally, we engage in a discussion concerning the challenges associated with defining and implementing these metrics, with particular emphasis on confounding factors such as the target audience, evaluation methods, and prompt techniques involved in the evaluation process.

AB  - Collaboration is key to STEM, where multidisciplinary team research can solve complex problems. However, inequality in STEM fields hinders their full potential, due to persistent psychological barriers in underrepresented students' experience. This paper documents teamwork in STEM and explores the transformative potential of computational modeling and generative AI in promoting STEM-team diversity and inclusion. Leveraging generative AI, this paper outlines two primary areas for advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion. First, formalizing collaboration assessment with inclusive analytics can capture fine-grained learner behavior. Second, adaptive, personalized AI systems can support diversity and inclusion in STEM teams. Four policy recommendations highlight AI's capacity: formalized collaborative skill assessment, inclusive analytics, funding for socio-cognitive research, human-AI teaming for inclusion training. Researchers, educators, and policymakers can build an equitable STEM ecosystem. This roadmap advances AI-enhanced collaboration, offering a vision for the future of STEM where diverse voices are actively encouraged and heard within collaborative scientific endeavors.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) models has been the highlight of digital transformation in the year 2022. As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it's critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.

KW  - ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Two critical policy questions will determine the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the knowledge economy and the creative sector. The first concerns how we think about the training of such models-in particular, whether the creators or owners of the data that are "scraped" (lawfully or unlawfully, with or without permission) should be compensated for that use. The second question revolves around the ownership of the output generated by AI, which is continually improving in quality and scale. These topics fall in the realm of intellectual property, a legal framework designed to incentivize and reward only human creativity and innovation. For some years, however, Britain has maintained a distinct category for "computer-generated" outputs; on the input issue, the EU and Singapore have recently introduced exceptions allowing for text and data mining or computational data analysis of existing works. This article explores the broader implications of these policy choices, weighing the advantages of reducing the cost of content creation and the value of expertise against the potential risk to various careers and sectors of the economy, which might be rendered unsustainable. Lessons may be found in the music industry, which also went through a period of unrestrained piracy in the early digital era, epitomized by the rise and fall of the file-sharing service Napster. Similar litigation and legislation may help navigate the present uncertainty, along with an emerging market for "legitimate" models that respect the copyright of humans and are clear about the provenance of their own creations.

AB  - This study explores university students' perceptions of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness to engage, potential benefits and challenges, and effective integration. A survey of 399 undergraduate and postgraduate students from various disciplines in Hong Kong revealed a generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and learning. Students recognized the potential for personalized learning support, writing and brainstorming assistance, and research and analysis capabilities. However, concerns about accuracy, privacy, ethical issues, and the impact on personal development, career prospects, and societal values were also expressed. According to John Biggs' 3P model, student perceptions significantly influence learning approaches and outcomes. By understanding students' perceptions, educators and policymakers can tailor GenAI technologies to address needs and concerns while promoting effective learning outcomes. Insights from this study can inform policy development around the integration of GenAI technologies into higher education. By understanding students' perceptions and addressing their concerns, policymakers can create well-informed guidelines and strategies for the responsible and effective implementation of GenAI tools, ultimately enhancing teaching and learning experiences in higher education.

AB  - The recent sudden increase in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and generative AI in general, has astonished education professionals and learners. In formulating a response to these developments, educational institutions are constrained by a lack of clarity concerning human -machine communication and its relationship to models of education. Ideas and models from the cybernetic tradition can help to fill this gap. Two paradigms are distinguished: (1) the transmission paradigm (combining the model of learning implied by the instruments and processes of formal education and the conduit model of communication), and (2) the coordination paradigm (combining the constructivist model of learning and the coordination model of communication). It is proposed that these paradigms have long coexisted in educational practice in a modus vivendi, which is disrupted by LLMs. If an LLM can pass an examination, then from within the transmission paradigm this can only understood as demonstrating that the LLM has indeed learned and understood the material being assessed. At the same time, we know that LLMs do not in fact have the capacity to learn and understand, but rather generate a simulacrum of intelligence. It is argued that this paradox prevents educational institutions from formulating a coherent response to generative AI systems. However, within the coordination paradigm the interactions of LLMs and education institutions can be more easily understood and can be situated in a conversational model of learning. These distinctions can help institutions, educational leaders, and teachers, to frame the complex and nuanced questions raised by GenAI, and to chart a course towards its effective use in education. More specifically, they indicate that to benefit fully from the capabilities of generative AI education institutions need to recognize the validity of the coordination paradigm and adapt their processes and instruments accordingly.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse education in the use of the Chat Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process. Background: The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation. Design: Discussion paper. Methods: We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results. Results: In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases. Conclusions: Using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time -efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical -thinking and factchecking.

AB  - This paper takes the occasion of French DJ David Guetta's use of generative AI tools to create lyrics and a voice in the style of Eminem, which he then used in one of his concerts, as the basis for an exploration of the shifting meaning of creativity and originality in the age of generative AI. Our main contention is that the Guetta form of creativity with generative AI tools differs in certain important respects from what has come before.The paper describes an iterative, dynamic process of conception, prompting, generation, refining, and deployment to characterise creativity in this context. Nevertheless, we contend that copyright - specifically the concept of originality as articulated in US federal law - is a sufficiently durable legal mechanism that can manage these new cultural forms, and that the two basic requirements of modern copyright law (a tangible medium of expression and a modest degree of creativity) remain relevant in identifying the scope of legal protection. The paper argues that the David Guetta story reveals something more general about creativity in a digital age, namely that while hybrid-networked (i.e., human - corporate - machine) creators have always created hybridnetworked cultural forms (i.e., creations that blend human and technology-constituted elements), such hybridity becomes increasingly visible and complex in the context of a new world of generative AI. At the very least, earlier - and influential - models of creativity as human-driven involving creation ex nihilo become harder to sustain in a new age of generative AI. But this does not mean copyright or notions of originality are redundant or that copyright law cannot accommodate Guetta and other cases. Such an account seems important as it challenges the hegemonic and reductive view that AI "generates" artistic works autonomously and avoids reducing the copyright issues raised by such creative works to the related but distinct question of whether learning models rely on copyrighted data. As such, copyright law should remain an important mechanism to facilitate genuine creators who are using AI systems in innovative and unique ways to push the boundaries of their creativity.

KW  - Medical ethics training
KW  - Principlism
KW  - Generative AI
KW  - Large language models
AB  - In this article I discuss the ethical ramifications for medical ethics training of the availability of large language models (LLMs) for medical students. My focus is on the practical ethical consequences for what we should expect of medical students in terms of medical professionalism and ethical reasoning, and how this can be tested in a context where LLMs are relatively easy available. If we continue to expect ethical competences of medical professionalism of future physicians, how much - if at all - should we worry that such generative AI may compromise adequate testing of medical students' abilities in this regard? I mainly focus on assessment methods based on written assignments of the 'student paper' type and consider whether LLMs make it unfeasible for assessors to gauge whether output is student-generated or 'machine-generated' and, if so, whether this is a problem. My take on this research question unfolds in three interwoven arguments, claiming that the advent of LLMs may offer a momentum (i) to reaffirm the importance of context-sensitive interpretation and specification of ethical principles in medical ethics training, (ii) to provide more supportive circumstances to assessors to allow them to meet scoring demands entailed by the importance that is placed on medical professionalism, and (iii) to complement written assignments with verbal (group) discussion to train and test students' skills to habitually recognize that 'moral solutions' can be normatively questioned and specified from various perspectives.

AB  - Generative AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), have the potential to bring significant advancements to the tourism and hospitality industry through an array of ingenious features. ChatGPT, as a type of generative AI, is a state-of-the-art LLM that is bundled with extensive capabilities. This commentary provides an early snapshot of ChatGPT's ability to enhance the tourist decision-making process in the pre-trip, en-route, and post-trip stages. Particularly, ChatGPT greatly differentiates itself from the traditional travel decision-making process by putting the tourist in the driver's seat to actively probe for highly relevant information through a question-and-answer mode. In this research note, we present different scenarios with cases demonstrating how ChatGPT can improve tourists' experience in these three travel stages, with trip planning efficiency, customized recommendations, 24/7 personal assistant, AI-mediated communication fluency, autonomous guided tours, enriched sharing experience, and AI-induced prolonged satisfaction. In summary, these value-added autonomous services provide tourists with travel solutions that are highly cost-effective, offering customized information that allows them to travel with ease.

AB  - In the past few years, we have witnessed the rapid development and exponential growth of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies including large language models (LLMs)-enabled ChatGPT and peripheral innovations. These technologies are designed to be humanlike intelligence and intuitive by providing direct access to systems using application programming interfaces (APIs). The GAI applications can fundamentally change economic and financial activities, through revolutionizing the ways that humans interact with machines and giving rise to new modes of production and behavior patterns. It is imperative to develop a new research paradigm that is more suitable than the currently dominating conventional research paradigms. This article presents the new paradigm for economic and financial research with GAI, covering the research objectives, scientific data, and models, and explores the underlying impact and perspective that bring to this field. We elaborate on the potential five scenarios including portfolio management, economic and financial prediction, extreme scenario analysis, policy analysis, and financial fraud detection. The new research paradigm with GAI proposed in this article can provide significant insights for a comprehensive understanding of innovation and transformation in this domain.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, like ChatGPT, have the potential to perpetuate and amplify cultural biases embedded in their training data, which are predominantly produced by dominant cultural groups. This paper explores the philosophical and technical challenges of detecting and mitigating cultural bias in generative AI, drawing on Plato's Allegory of the Cave to frame the issue as a problem of limited and distorted representation. We propose a multifaceted approach combining technical interventions, such as data diversification and culturally aware model constraints, with a deeper engagement with the cultural and philosophical dimensions of the problem. Drawing on theories of extended cognition and situated knowledge, we argue that mitigating AI biases requires a reflexive interrogation of the cultural contexts of AI development and a commitment to empowering marginalized voices and perspectives. We claim that controlling cultural bias in generative AI is inseparable from the larger project of promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion in AI development and governance. By bridging philosophical reflection with technical innovation, this paper contributes to the growing discourse on responsible and inclusive AI, offering a roadmap for detecting and mitigating cultural biases while grappling with the profound cultural implications of these powerful technologies.

AB  - Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have been steadily adopted and embedded into energy infrastructure following the rapid transformation of energy grids through distributed consumption, renewables generation, and battery storage. The data streams produced by such energy IoT infrastructure can be extracted, processed, analyzed, and synthesized for informed decision-making that delivers optimized grid operations, reduced costs, and net-zero carbon emissions. However, the voluminous nature of such data streams leads to an equally large number of analysis outcomes that have proven ineffective in decision-making by energy grid operators. This gap can be addressed by introducing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, or more formally conversational agents, to proactively assist human operators in analyzing and identifying decision opportunities in energy grids. In this research, we draw upon the recent success of generative AI for optimized AI chatbots with natural language understanding and generation capabilities for the complex information needs of energy IoT infrastructure and net-zero emissions. The proposed approach for optimized generative AI chatbots is composed of six core modules: Intent Classifier, Knowledge Extractor, Database Retriever, Cached Hierarchical Vector Storage, Secure Prompting, and Conversational Interface with Language Generator. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach and the optimized generative AI chatbot in the real-world setting of an energy IoT infrastructure deployed at a large, multi-campus tertiary education institution. The results of these experiments confirm the contribution of generative AI chatbots in simplifying the complexity of energy IoT infrastructure for optimized grid operations and net-zero carbon emissions.

AB  - Utilizing generative artificial intelligence, especially the more popularly used Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture, has made it possible to employ AI in ways that were previously not possible with conventional assessment and evaluation technologies for learning. As educational use cases and academic studies become increasingly prevalent, it is critical for education stakeholders to discuss design considerations and ideals that are key in supporting and augmenting learning via quality classroom discourse that sets the climate for student learning and thinking, and teachers' transmission of expectations. In this paper, we seek to address how emergent technological advancements such as GPT, can be considered and utilized in designs that are consistent with the ideals of sustainable student discourse and knowledge creation. We showcase contemporary exemplars of possible designs and practices that are based on the pedagogy of knowledge building, with recent illustrations of how GPT may be utilized to sustain students' knowledge building discourse. We also examine the potential effects and repercussions of technological utilization and misuse, along with insights into GPT's role in supporting and enhancing knowledge building practices. We anticipate that the findings, through our exploration of designs and practices for knowledge creation, will be able to resonate with a broader audience and instigate meaningful change on issues of teaching and learning within smart learning environments.

In that sense, we aim to position the field of education going forward with the implications of new technologies like GenAI for education and educational research. We argue the need for a dual-lens approach. First and foremost, practice and research should focus on the here-and-now, i.e. how to design powerful learning experiences for pre-service and in-service teachers for them to be productive, creative, critical, and ethical users. But there is also a need for a deeper, longer view-based on sociological and historical trends and patterns that will influence the socio-techno-cultural matrix within which education functions in the long term. We begin with a brief introduction to GenAI technologies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the fundamental nature of GenAI tools-their similarities and differences to prior technologies, and the implications for teacher education and research.

AB  - This article sets out to bring E. F. Schumacher's social theory of technology into dialogue with recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). By generative AI, we are here referring to a new constellation of machine learning technologies that aim to simulate and, subsequently, automate human creativity, with a particular focus on OpenAI's GPT-3 family (ChatGPT and DALL-E). Often overlooked in contemporary debates on machine learning and AI, we argue that Schumacher's 1973 book, Small is Beautiful, offers a series of insights and concepts that are increasingly relevant for the development of a humanist politics under conditions of computation. With a particular focus on Schumacher's account of 'intermediate technology', we suggest that his emphasis on the social role of human creativity and identification of scale as a crucial concept to deploy in critiquing technology together provide a unique framework within which to (a) address the rise of what we call 'pathologies of meaning' and (b) offer a powerful way to consider alternatives to the gigantisms of the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and Silicon Valley-style ideologies of digital transformation.

AB  - The use of generative AI systems is on the rise. As a result, we are increasingly often conversing with AI chatbots rather than with fellow humans. This increasing use of AI systems leads to legal challenges as well, particularly when the chatbot provides incorrect information. In this article, we study whether someone who decides to contract on the basis of incorrect information provided by a generative AI chatbot might invoke the fraud regime to annul the resulting contract in various legal systems. During this analysis, it becomes clear that some of the requirements that are currently being put forward from a public law perspective, such as in the European AI Act, may also naturally arise from existing private law figures. In the same vein, this analysis highlights the interesting intradisciplinary feedback between instruments of public law and other legal domains.

AB  - PurposeWith the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI), it is important to consider how young people are making sense of these tools in their everyday lives. Drawing on critical postdigital approaches to learning and literacy, this study aims to center the experiences and perspectives of young people who encounter and experiment with generative AI in their daily writing practices.Design/methodology/approachThis critical case study of one digital platform - Character.ai - brings together an adolescent and adult authorship team to inquire about the intertwining of young people's playful and critical perspectives when writing on/with digital platforms. Drawing on critical walkthrough methodology (Light et al., 2018), the authors engage digital methods to study how the creative and "fun" uses of AI in youths' writing lives are situated in broader platform ecologies.FindingsThe findings suggest experimentation and pleasure are key aspects of young people's engagement with generative AI. The authors demonstrate how one platform works to capitalize on these dimensions, even as youth users engage critically and artfully with the platform and develop their digital writing practices.Practical implicationsThis study highlights how playful experimentation with generative AI can engage young people both in pleasurable digital writing and in exploration and contemplation of platforms dynamics and structures that shape their and others' literate activities. Educators can consider young people's creative uses of these evolving technologies as potential opportunities to develop a critical awareness of how commercial platforms seek to benefit from their users.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the development of a critical and humanist research agenda around generative AI by centering the experiences, perspectives and practices of young people who are underrepresented in the burgeoning research devoted to AI and literacies.

AB  - History theory does not have a mature theory of questions. This reflects both historical and philosophical assumptions. As Holly Case has argued in The Age of Questions (2018), the big questions of the nineteenth century and their proposed final solutions arguably primed the murderous logic of genocide in the first half of the twentieth century. On her account, questions have become tamed as technical tools in historical monographs and reviews like this one. This picture of the twentieth century, though, runs up against R. G. Collingwood's historiographical logic of questions and the rise of erotetic logics in computer science. Computational erotetic logics have shaped the creation of large language models such as the GPT series and focused our attention on expressivity, effectivity, and classification in the relation of questions and answers. Collingwood's logic is different, using the relation of questions to questions to point to presuppositions. This metaphysical view of erotetic logic is timely, for it reminds why it might be so hard for historians to cut through with true propositions in an age of AI. Collingwood reminds us that a focus on truth-evaluable answers to questions does not explain why those questions were asked in the first place. Chasing chains of questions back to presuppositions, Collingwood argues that tackling what is assumed and what is lived with can help historians to change an unthinking world. In our age, this includes the idea of a shift from historians being the users of large language models to historians being the designers of new forms of relationship between people and information.

AB  - The new wave of 'foundation models'-general-purpose generative AI models, for production of text (e.g., ChatGPT) or images (e.g., MidJourney)-represent a dramatic advance in the state of the art for AI. But their use also introduces a range of new risks, which has prompted an ongoing conversation about possible regulatory mechanisms. Here we propose a specific principle that should be incorporated into legislation: that any organization developing a foundation model intended for public use must demonstrate a reliable detection mechanism for the content it generates, as a condition of its public release. The detection mechanism should be made publicly available in a tool that allows users to query, for an arbitrary item of content, whether the item was generated (wholly or partly) by the model. In this paper, we argue that this requirement is technically feasible and would play an important role in reducing certain risks from new AI models in many domains. We also outline a number of options for the tool's design, and summarize a number of points where further input from policymakers and researchers would be required.

KW  - futures corpus
KW  - generative AI
AB  - For highly time-constrained, very short-term investors, reading and extracting valuable information from financial news poses significant challenges. The wide range of topics covered in these news articles further compounds the difficulties for investors. The diverse content adds complexity and uncertainty to the text, making it arduous for very short-term investors to swiftly and accurately extract valuable insights. Variations between authors, media sources, and cultural backgrounds also introduce additional complexities. Hence, performing a bull-bear semantic analysis of financial news using text mining technologies can alleviate the volume, time, and energy pressures on very short-term investors, while enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of their investment decisions. This study proposes labeling bull-bear words using a futures corpus detection method that extracts valuable information from financial news, allowing investors to quickly understand market trends. Generative AI models are trained to provide real-time bull-bear advice, aiding investors in adapting to market changes and devising effective trading strategies. Experimental results show the effectiveness of various models, with random forest and SVMs achieving an impressive 80% accuracy rate. MLP and deep learning models also perform well. By leveraging these models, the study reduces the time spent reading financial articles, enabling faster decision making and increasing the likelihood of investment success. Future research can explore the application of this method in other domains and enhance model design for improved predictive capabilities and practicality.

AB  - As advances in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to transform and revolutionize the field of medicine, understanding the potential uses of generative AI in health care becomes increasingly important. Generative AI, including models such as generative adversarial networks and large language models, shows promise in transforming medical diagnostics, research, treatment planning, and patient care. However, these data -intensive systems pose new threats to protected health information. This Viewpoint paper aims to explore various categories of generative AI in health care, including medical diagnostics, drug discovery, virtual health assistants, medical research, and clinical decision support, while identifying security and privacy threats within each phase of the life cycle of such systems (ie, data collection, model development, and implementation phases). The objectives of this study were to analyze the current state of generative AI in health care, identify opportunities and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats associated with generative AI in health care to ensure the safe and effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform the development of future generative AI systems in health care and help health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with these systems.

KW  - Higher education
KW  - ChatGPT
KW  - Academic integrity
AB  - The public release of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT) has had a disruptive effect on the assessment practices of higher education institutions (HEIs) worldwide. Concerns have largely been associated with academic integrity, cheating and plagiarism. HEIs have had to develop guidelines in response to GAI. As many of these guidelines were developed in haste and could affect a large number of instructors and students, there is a need to examine their content, coverage and suitability. This review examines the extent to which the world's 50 top-ranking HEIs have developed or modified their assessment guidelines to address GAI use and, where guidelines exist, the primary content and advice given to guide instructors in their GAI assessment design and practices. The findings show that just under half of the institutions have developed publicly available guidelines. The guidelines cover three main areas: academic integrity, advice on assessment design and communicating with students. Amongst the suggestions for teachers on assessment design, two appear particularly pertinent in helping develop effective assessment tasks and developing learners' AI literacy: first, running assessment tasks through GAI to check the extent to which the tool can accomplish the task and, second, having students use GAI as part of the assessment process. Overall, the review suggests that HEIs have come to accept the use of GAI and drafted assessment guidelines to advise instructors on its use. In the article, we argue that it may be beneficial to embrace GAI as a part of the assessment process since this is the reality of today's educational and job landscape. This will require instructors to develop a new competence - generative artificial intelligence assessment literacy - which is conceptualised in this article.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, are promising for revolutionizing data and information management in healthcare and medicine. However, there is scant literature guiding their integration for non-AI professionals. This study conducts a scoping literature review to address the critical need for guidance on integrating generative AI and LLMs into healthcare and medical practices. It elucidates the distinct mechanisms underpinning these technologies, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLFH), including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning, which differentiates them from traditional, rule-based AI systems. It requires an inclusive, collaborative co-design process that engages all pertinent stakeholders, including clinicians and consumers, to achieve these benefits. Although global research is examining both opportunities and challenges, including ethical and legal dimensions, LLMs offer promising advancements in healthcare by enhancing data management, information retrieval, and decision-making processes. Continued innovation in data acquisition, model fine-tuning, prompt strategy development, evaluation, and system implementation is imperative for realizing the full potential of these technologies. Organizations should proactively engage with these technologies to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency, adhering to ethical and legal guidelines for responsible application.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of generative AI on international diplomacy through the lens of EU-China diplomatic relationship-building. The first section introduces the broader context of AI's geopolitical impact by distinguishing two different models-the European and Chinese models of regulating and implementing generative AI. The second discuss or explain how the two AI models contrast one another. The third section of the paper focuses on discussing Generative AI and its possible implications for EU-China relations, the extent to which their efforts are likely to strain or facilitate diplomatic relationship-building. The fourth section takes the analysis forward by examining how generative AI could be an unexpected enabling force for EU-China relationship-building. This paper purports that the distinctive EU and Chinese models of generative AI too often belie the opportunities that could potentially enable the EU and China to build their relationship, since generative AI raises shared concerns for the EU and China, and utilising generative AI could make their communications become more efficient, the EU and China may come to reach some kind of shared framework for generative AI development and governance; this could lead to productive talks in other domains such as the trade deficit issue plaguing the EU-China relations or more sensitive cross-strait issues; moreover, in the realm of public diplomacy generative AI could facilitate the EU and China's public diplomatic efforts towards each other.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform many aspects of scholarly publishing. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors might use AI in a variety of ways, and those uses might augment their existing work or might instead be intended to replace it. We are editors of bioethics and humanities journals who have been contemplating the implications of this ongoing transformation. We believe that generative AI may pose a threat to the goals that animate our work but could also be valuable for achieving those goals. In the interests of fostering a wider conversation about how generative AI may be used, we have developed a preliminary set of recommendations for its use in scholarly publishing. We hope that the recommendations and rationales set out here will help the scholarly community navigate toward a deeper understanding of the strengths, limits, and challenges of AI for responsible scholarly work.

AB  - Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat have garnered increasing attention on a global scale. Previous studies have focused mostly on the influence of generative AI on writing while few researchers have investigated how generative AI can facilitate students' multimodal writing process. To fill in this gap, we explored the generative AI-assisted composing processes of two groups of English as a foreign language (EFL) writers over two weeks in this qualitative study. One group completed a multimodal PowerPoint (PPT) project, and the other group completed a traditional argumentative essay project. Our data consist of students' screen recordings with think-aloud protocols, final multimodal texts, and post-project interviews. Our analysis showed different patterns in text production across the two groups. Students in the PPT group tended to construct more bridge texts and examples to corroborate their sub-claims in the hierarchical order. They also inclined to borrow the summarized search results from the Bing Chat to expand texts for their PPT slides. With regard to image generation for PPT slides, descriptions of AI images from ChatGPT were used as effective prompts to generate AI images from Bing Image Creator. Moreover, students were interested in producing and refining AI images following the recommended prompts by Bing Chat. They also evaluated these AI images from different perspectives. We conclude the study with a discussion on the pedagogical implications and suggestions for further study.

KW  - Generative AI
KW  - Creative labour
KW  - Mediation
KW  - Materiality
KW  - Relationality
AB  - The recent emergence of generative AI software as viable tools for use in the cultural and creative industries has sparked debates about the potential for "creativity" to be automated and "augmented" by algorithmic machines. Such discussions, however, begin from an ontological position, attempting to define creativity by either falling prey to universalism (i.e. "creativity is X") or reductionism (i.e. "only humans can be truly creative" or "human creativity will be fully replaced by creative machines"). Furthermore, such an approach evades addressing the real and material impacts of AI on creative labour in these industries. This article thus offers more expansive methodological and conceptual approaches to the recent hype on generative AI. By combining (Csikszentmihalyi, The systems model of creativity, Springer, Dordrecht, 2014) systems view of creativity, in which we emphasise the shift from "what" to "where" is creativity, with (Lievrouw, Media technologies, The MIT Press, 2014) relational-materialist theory of "mediation", we argue that the study of "creativity" in the context of generative AI must be attentive to the interactions between technologies, practices, and social arrangements. When exploring the relational space between these elements, three core concepts become pertinent: creative labour, automation, and distributed agency. Critiquing "creativity" through these conceptual lenses allows us to re-situate the use of generative AI within discourses of labour in post-industrial capitalism and brings us to a conceptualisation of creativity that privileges neither the human user nor machine algorithm but instead emphasises a relational and distributed form of agency.

AB  - The recent evolution of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has already made a tangible impact within the realm of education. Positioned at the forefront of information and digital literacies, teacher librarians (TLs) can be leaders in exploring the potential for AI platforms to transform learning and teaching. This research is based on an exploratory methodology, to investigate how TLs might teach with and about GAI by applying the CATWOE analysis technique [Checkland, P., & Poulter, J. (2006). Learning for action: A short definitive account of soft systems methodology, and its use for practitioners, teachers and students. Wiley.] within the context of three specific GAI platforms. Findings highlight the multifaceted role that TLs can assume, extending beyond the pedagogical integration of GAI to encompass a broader educational mandate: to scaffold students' capabilities as critical and ethical users of these tools in the creation and use of information.

AB  - Generative AI tools powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in understanding and articulating legal facts closer to the level of legal practitioners. However, scholars hold contrasting views on the reliability of the reasoning behind a decision derived from LLMs due to its black-box nature. Law firms are vigilant in recognizing the potential risks of violating confidentiality and inappropriate exposure of sensitive legal data through the prompt sent to Generative AI. This research attempts to find an equilibrium between responsible usage and control of human legal professionals over content produced by Generative AI through regular audits. It investigates the potential of Generative AI in drafting correspondence for pre-litigation decisions derived from an eXplainable AI (XAI) algorithm. This research presents an end-to-end process of designing the architecture and methodology for a blockchain-based auditing system. It detects unauthorized alterations of data repositories containing the decisions by an XAI model and automated textual explanation by Generative AI. The automated auditing by blockchain facilitates responsible usage of AI technologies and reduces discrepancies in tracing the accountability of adversarial decisions. It conceptualizes the two algorithms. First, strategic on-chain (within blockchain) and off-chain (outside blockchain) data storage in compliance with the data protection laws and critical requirements of stakeholders in a legal firm. Second, auditing by comparison of the unique signature as Merkle roots of files stored off-chain with their immutable blockchain counterpart. A case study on liability cases under tort law demonstrates the system implementation results.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM
LA  - English
AB  - What is it in virtue of which any poetic output will be included or excluded from the category of art? I will first identify the external demarcation problem, which is concerned with whether or how the cut-off is made between art and non-art. I will then adopt a nonclassical approach to conceptual analysis by relying on a set of examples of poetry generated by aleatory processes to evaluate an intention-based response to the external demarcation problem. I will argue in favor of an intention-based response that is grounded in hypothetical intentionalism. According to this response, a contextually informed audience will form a hypothesis about poetic intentions on the basis of the evidence that a work makes publicly available. Semantic, categorial, and ostensive intention and intention traces may help this audience to determine whether a work counts as art and is worth effortful interpretation. My proposed version of an intention-based response to the external demarcation problem will be based on the p-valued hypothesis-testing approach in science and will be highly relevant to a context of production in which we find human poets, poetry-generating AI systems, and human-AI interfaces.

AB  - Generative pretrained models have achieved remarkable success in various domains such as language and computer vision. Specifically, the combination of large-scale diverse datasets and pretrained transformers has emerged as a promising approach for developing foundation models. Drawing parallels between language and cellular biology (in which texts comprise words; similarly, cells are defined by genes), our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetic research. Using burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications. This includes tasks such as cell type annotation, multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, perturbation response prediction and gene network inference.
   Pretrained using over 33 million single-cell RNA-sequencing profiles, scGPT is a foundation model facilitating a broad spectrum of downstream single-cell analysis tasks by transfer learning.

AB  - Spoken communication between social robotic devices, powered by generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, and the senior population offers great potential for researching social interaction and robot identity perceptions as well as exploring the potential opportunities and challenges when implementing this human-machine interactions in real life situations and health care. In this paper we explore people's perceptions of the social robot Furhat when administering verbal tasks similar to those used in screening for Alzheimer's disease. We describe the Slovak system mounted on the robot that includes a speech recognizer, the scenarios powered by generative large language model ChatGPT, and a speech synthesizer. We tested the functionality of the proposed approach with two groups of participants: attendees of a large science fair and a scientific conference. The observations from 87 collected questionnaires suggest good potential and applicability of such an approach for the given task and more positive attitudes of older subjects compared to younger ones.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting developments in Computer Science of the last decade. At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models like DALL center dot E 2 can interpret prompts and generate high-quality images that exhibit human creativity. Though public enthusiasm is booming, systematic auditing of potential gender biases in AI-generated images remains scarce. We addressed this gap by examining the prevalence of two occupational gender biases (representational and presentational biases) in 15,300 DALL center dot E 2 images spanning 153 occupations. We assessed potential bias amplification by benchmarking against the 2021 U.S. census data and Google Images. Our findings reveal that DALL center dot E 2 underrepresents women in male-dominated fields while overrepresenting them in female-dominated occupations. Additionally, DALL center dot E 2 images tend to depict more women than men with smiles and downward-pitching heads, particularly in female-dominated (versus male-dominated) occupations. Our algorithm auditing study demonstrates more pronounced representational and presentational biases in DALL center dot E 2 compared to Google Images and calls for feminist interventions to curtail the potential impacts of such biased AI-generated images on the media ecology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like DALL center dot E 2 are great at turning text into creative images. Despite the fact that many people are excited about adopting this technology, not much research has been done on gender biases in the images AI generates. Our study looked at this issue by examining over 15,000 images created by DALL center dot E 2 that depict people in 153 different jobs. We compared these AI-generated images with job data from the 2021 U.S. census and pictures found on Google Images. We found that DALL center dot E 2 often underrepresents women in jobs where men are more common but overrepresents them in jobs where women are more common. Additionally, the AI tends to show more women than men with smiling faces and heads tilted down, particularly in jobs where women are more common. This could lead to misconceptions about women's roles and abilities in these occupations. Our research found that these biases in DALL center dot E 2 images are more severe than those in Google Images. This highlights the need for efforts to reduce gender biases in AI so that we will not reinforce gender stereotypes and ensure fair representation of both women and men in AI-generated images.

KW  - Statutory license
KW  - Fair remuneration
AB  - Generative AI is disrupting the creative process(es) of intellectual works on an unparalleled scale. Algorithmic tools are increasing users' production capacity for literary and artistic works to almost infinite levels. However, the quality of the outputs is strictly dependent on the quantity and quality of the inputs, some of which are protected by copyright. This scenario gave raise to tensions between copyright holders and generative AI companies. While the formers claim control over this new kind of exploitation of their works, the latters wish to train their algorithms freely with as many contents as possible. This contribution suggests exploring the idea of introducing a statutory license for machine learning purposes as a compromise solution to ensure an attractive environment for artificial intelligence without marginalizing the role played by human authors. This remuner-ation proposal is rooted in a fundamental rights analysis that balances i.e., the right to science and culture and freedom of artistic expression (Arts. 11 and 13 EUCF, 19 UDHR, 27.1 UDHR, 15.1 a and b ICESCR) vis-`a-vis the right for creators to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from their scientific, literary or artistic production (Arts. 17.2 EUCF, 27.2 UDHR, and 15.1 c ICESCR).

AB  - Digital storytelling and generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms have emerged as transformative tools that empower individuals to write with confidence and share their stories effectively. However, a research gap exists in understanding the effects of using such web-based platforms on narrative intelligence and writing self-efficacy. This study aims to investigate whether digital story creation tasks on web-based platforms can influence the narrative intelligence and writing self-efficacy of undergraduate students. A pretest-posttest comparison study between two groups was conducted with sixty-four undergraduate students (n = 64), majoring in Primary Education. More specifically, it compares the effects of the most well-known conventional platforms, such as Storybird, Storyjumper, and ZooBurst (control condition), and generative AI platforms, such as Sudowrite, Jasper, and Shortly AI (experimental condition) on undergraduate students, with an equal distribution in each group. The findings indicate that the utilization of generative AI platforms in the context of story creation tasks can substantially enhance both narrative intelligence scores and writing self-efficacy when compared to conventional platforms. Nonetheless, there was no significant difference in the creative identity factor. Generative AI platforms have promising implications for supporting undergraduates' narrative intelligence and writing self-efficacy in fostering their story creation design and development.

AB  - Accurately diagnosing various winding deformation faults is significant in power transformer maintenance. Among the different fault diagnosis methods, frequency response analysis (FRA) is widely used but still poses challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have recently been proposed to interpret FRA data. Nevertheless, these approaches are either complicated or exhibit limited generalization performance due to real-world FRA fault data scarcity. Inspired by AI-generated content (AIGC), this study proposes a data augmentation technique named conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (Conditional-WGAN-GP) combined with fault diagnosis model. Numerous FRA-based data are automatically generated using the proposed data augmentation technique based on real FRA data obtained from a specially designed 10 kV transformer. The augmented dataset is then used to train fault diagnosis models to detect winding deformation faults. The trained fault diagnosis model is subsequently applied to assess two actual transformers. Experimental results demonstrate that when combined with the proposed method, even simpler fault diagnosis models can achieve high accuracy, exhibiting an improvement of approximately 5 % compared to the previous baseline model. The fault diagnosis models combined with the proposed data augmentation technique demonstrate improved generalization and robustness.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between student perceptions and their intention to use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in higher education. With a sample of 405 students participating in the study, their knowledge, perceived value, and perceived cost of using the technology were measured by an Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) instrument. The scales were first validated and the correlations between the different components were subsequently estimated. The results indicate a strong positive correlation between perceived value and intention to use generative AI, and a weak negative correlation between perceived cost and intention to use. As we continue to explore the implications of GenAI in education and other domains, it is crucial to carefully consider the potential long-term consequences and the ethical dilemmas that may arise from widespread adoption.

AB  - Scientific journals, crucial components of our epistemic infrastructure, have continuously adapted to the changing technological landscape. Today, we stand at the precipice of a transformative phase brought about by generative AI, specifically large language models such as OpenAI's GPT and Google's Bard. In this opinion piece, I examine the implications of these models for the future of scientific journals and various stakeholders in the scientific community, including journals, scholars, and universities. To envisage the future trajectory of scientific journals, it's imperative to comprehend the operational mechanisms of these models and the fundamentally recombinatorial nature of human knowledge creation. I suggest that one of the significant roles generative AI can play is facilitating "long jumps" in our knowledge exploration process. I further propose decentralization and deferred and temporary binding as two crucial characteristics of the evolving epistemic infrastructure that supports precarious knowledge production. I foresee a future where scientific journals extend beyond their traditional gatekeeping roles. I call for scholars-as authors, reviewers, and mentors-to utilize these technologies to traverse the broad landscape of potential knowledge, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic scientific ecosystem.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a framework designed to help educators assess the effectiveness of popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in solving authentic assessments. We employed Bloom's taxonomy as a guiding principle to create authentic assessments that evaluate the capabilities of generative AI tools. We applied this framework to assess the abilities of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing in solving authentic assessments in economics. We found that generative AI tools perform very well at the lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy while still maintaining a decent level of performance at the higher levels, with "create" being the weakest level of performance. Interestingly, these tools are better able to address numeric-based questions than text-based ones. Moreover, all the generative AI tools exhibit weaknesses in building arguments based on theoretical frameworks, maintaining the coherence of different arguments and providing appropriate references. Our study provides educators with a framework to assess the capabilities of generative AI tools, enabling them to make more informed decisions regarding assessments and learning activities. Our findings demand a strategic reimagining of educational goals and assessments, emphasising higher cognitive skills and calling for a concerted effort to enhance the capabilities of educators in preparing students for a rapidly transforming professional environment.

TI  - The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or generative AI) in healthcare
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.

AB  - We deploy a prompt-augmented GPT-4 model to distill comprehensive datasets on the global application of debt-for-nature swaps (DNS), a pivotal financial tool for environmental conservation. Our analysis includes 195 nations and identifies 21 countries that have not yet used DNS before as prime candidates for DNS. A significant proportion demonstrates consistent commitments to conservation finance (0.86 accuracy as compared to historical swaps records). Conversely, 35 countries previously active in DNS before 2010 have since been identified as unsuitable. Notably, Argentina, grappling with soaring inflation and a substantial sovereign debt crisis, and Poland, which has achieved economic stability and gained access to alternative EU conservation funds, exemplify the shifting suitability landscape. The study's outcomes illuminate the fragility of DNS as a conservation strategy amid economic and political volatility.

AB  - In 2023, the global use of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and -4, witnessed a significant surge, sparking discussions on its sustainable implementation across various domains, including education from primary schools to universities. However, practical testing and evaluation in school education are still relatively unexplored. This article examines the utilization of generative AI in primary school education. The study involved 110 pupils, aged 8-14 years old, studying in the 4th-6th grades across four classes in two schools. Using laptops, pupils participated in test lessons where content, text, figures, and exercises were generated and modified using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-3.5. The results demonstrated that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5, as one example of generative AI, to personify learning material so that it would meet the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. A clear majority of pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI-modified material. There is a promising potential of generative AI use in school education, supporting pupils' motivated learning and skills development. However, these tools need to be developed, refined and optimized to ensure proper adaptation and to create impactful, inclusive, and sustainable learning in schools to benefit pupils, teachers and education managers alike.

AB  - In this forum piece, we argue that the widespread heraldry regarding artificial intelligence (AI) as a panacea in diplomacy and articulating research agendas on the changes it might bring are potentially clouding the future hardships of diplomacy. With all its subfields, International Relations (IR) has gone through numerous "turns", especially during the last two decades which made encounters poised to change the nature of foreign policy-such as new actors, ideas, or technologies-a familiar experience. While these discussions enriched the discipline of IR, hardly any of these turns lived up to their promises. Certainly, we have an increasingly challenging and complex multipolar world ahead of us. This manifests that a broader network of actors, interests, and technologies needs to be considered. AI, indeed, has the potential capacity to assist and disrupt the ways diplomacy works. Yet heralding an anticipatory practice and study of diplomacy based on AI's socio-technical imaginaries and calculations rather than as a participatory process centered on immediate human interaction, resources, intelligence, and rapport bears the potential of obscuring the analytical clarity needed. In short, we argue that the rise of AI should not be discussed as yet another new turn poised to cure diplomacy and international relations. We conclude our piece by reminding scholars to bring analytical focus on what lies at the heart of diplomacy.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to captivate the collective imagination through the latest generation of generative AI models such as DALL-E and ChatGPT, the dehumanizing and harmful features of the technology industry that have plagued it since its inception only seem to deepen and intensify. Far from a "glitch" or unintentional error, these endemic issues are a function of the interlocking systems of oppression upon which AI is built. Using the analytical framework of "Empire," this paper demonstrates that we live not simply in the "age of AI" but in the age of AI Empire. Specifically, we show that this networked and distributed global order is rooted in heteropatriarchy, racial capitalism, white supremacy, and coloniality and perpetuates its influence through the mechanisms of extractivism, automation, essentialism, surveillance, and containment. Therefore, we argue that any attempt at reforming AI from within the same interlocking oppressive systems that created it is doomed to failure and, moreover, risks exacerbating existing harm. Instead, to advance justice, we must radically transform not just the technology itself, but our ideas about it, and develop it from the bottom up, from the perspectives of those who stand the most risk of being harmed.

KW  - discourse analysis (DA)
KW  - artificial intelligence (AI)
KW  - qualitative research
AB  - The use of qualitative data analysis software (QDAS) platforms have always posed a dilemma for researchers, and the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are complexifying this relationship even further. The way QDAS companies are positioning this new development will impact how researchers understand what qualitative analysis is and what it could be. Using discourse analysis methods, we explored how ATLAS.ti, NVivo, and MAXQDA websites constructed the relationship between AI-assist and qualitative research methods. We noted four "discursive dilemmas" across the websites: (a) automated insight-generation versus systematic meaning-making; (b) chatting with documents versus analyzing data; (c) high speed versus high engagement; and (d) novelty versus agency. While some level of hyperbolic discourse can be expected from corporations whose goal is to sell products, we argue that the discourses used on these websites may be incompatible with the epistemological foundations of qualitative research.

TI  - A Security-enhanced Advertising Platform based on Blockchain and Edge Computing in Generative AI
T2  - APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA  - English
AB  - With the development of advertising technology, especially the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, the generation and editing of advertising content has become more convenient and efficient. However, this also brings new security risks to digital advertising. For example, in order to generate personalized advertising content, AI can collect user behavior data without the user's knowledge and automatically generate ads that are beneficial to advertisers. In addition, the main issue regarding outdoor advertising is whether the outdoor advertising platform can deliver the advertising content required by the advertiser at the designated place and time according to the actual requirements of the customer. Combining blockchain and edge computing technology, this paper builds a security-enhanced outdoor advertising platform. The decentralized, non-tamperable and traceable features of blockchain technology provide the advertising platform with credibility between users and advertisers, as well as credibility between advertisers and the advertising platform. At the same time, the terminal controller with edge processing capabilities improves the efficiency of advertising and enhances the task balance between the server and the playback side. Experimental results show that the platform can effectively manage user identities and maintain advertising plans. It not only improves data security and credibility, but also has good performance.

AB  - The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed various domains, including education. Generative AI models have garnered significant attention for their potential in educational settings, but image-generative AI models need to be more utilized. This study explores the potential of integrating generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, into art-focused STEAM classes. To this end, we combined STEAM education with image-generative AI. We designed and implemented a learning activity in which students used image-generative AI to generate creative images and wrote imaginative diaries inspired by AI-generated pictures. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected and analyzed data from surveys, interviews, and prompt datasets to gain insights into students' perceptions, motivations, and behaviors concerning the integration of generative AI in art education. Our study found that incorporating generative AI into art-focused STEAM classes may reduce the gap between male and female students' interest in art practices. We also found that the number of subjects in students' prompt datasets is linked to their divergent and convergent thinking. Finally, we discovered a meaningful correlation between the number of unique words in students' diaries and the image scores that researchers assessed. Our findings shed light on the relationship between students' divergent and convergent behaviors, offering valuable insights into their creative thinking processes. This study underscores the potential of integrating image-generative AI models in STEAM education.

AB  - Background: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), represented by large language models, have the potential to transform health care and medical education. In particular, GAI's impact on higher education has the potential to change students' learning experience as well as faculty's teaching. However, concerns have been raised about ethical consideration and decreased reliability of the existing examinations. Furthermore, in medical education, curriculum reform is required to adapt to the revolutionary changes brought about by the integration of GAI into medical practice and research. Objective: This study analyzes the impact of GAI on medical education curricula and explores strategies for adaptation. Methods: The study was conducted in the context of faculty development at a medical school in Japan. A workshop involving faculty and students was organized, and participants were divided into groups to address two research questions: (1) How does GAI affect undergraduate medical education curricula? and (2) How should medical school curricula be reformed to address the impact of GAI? The strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) framework was used, and cross-SWOT matrix analysis was used to devise strategies. Further, 4 researchers conducted content analysis on the data generated during the workshop discussions. Results: The data were collected from 8 groups comprising 55 participants. Further, 5 themes about the impact of GAI on medical education curricula emerged: improvement of teaching and learning, improved access to information, inhibition of existing learning processes, problems in GAI, and changes in physicians' professionality. Positive impacts included enhanced teaching and learning efficiency and improved access to information, whereas negative impacts included concerns about reduced independent thinking and the adaptability of existing assessment methods. Further, GAI was perceived to change the nature of physicians' expertise. Three themes emerged from the cross-SWOT analysis for curriculum reform: (1) learning about GAI, (2) learning with GAI, and (3) learning aside from GAI. Participants recommended incorporating GAI literacy, ethical considerations, and compliance into the curriculum. Learning with GAI involved improving learning efficiency, supporting information gathering and dissemination, and facilitating patient involvement. Learning aside from GAI emphasized maintaining GAI-free learning processes, fostering higher cognitive domains of learning, and introducing more communication exercises. Conclusions: This study highlights the profound impact of GAI on medical education curricula and provides insights into curriculum reform strategies. Participants recognized the need for GAI literacy, ethical education, and adaptive learning. Further, GAI was recognized as a tool that can enhance efficiency and involve patients in education. The study also suggests that medical education should focus on competencies that GAI hardly replaces, such as clinical experience and communication. Notably, involving both faculty and students in curriculum reform discussions fosters a sense of ownership and ensures broader perspectives are encompassed.

AB  - This study aimed to examine an assumption regarding whether generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can overcome the cognitive intensity that humans suffer when solving problems. We examine the performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on NAEP science assessments and compare their performance to students by cognitive demands of the items. Fifty-four 2019 NAEP science assessment tasks were coded by content experts using a two-dimensional cognitive load framework, including task cognitive complexity and dimensionality. ChatGPT and GPT-4 answered the questions individually and were scored using the scoring keys provided by NAEP. The analysis of the available data for this study was based on the average student ability scores for students who answered each item correctly and the percentage of students who responded to individual items. The results showed that both ChatGPT and GPT-4 consistently outperformed most students who answered each individual item in the NAEP science assessments. As the cognitive demand for NAEP science assessments increases, statistically higher average student ability scores are required to correctly address the questions. This pattern was observed for Grades 4, 8, and 12 students respectively. However, ChatGPT and GPT-4 were not statistically sensitive to the increase of cognitive demands of the tasks, except for Grade 4. As the first study focusing on comparing cutting-edge GAI and K-12 students in problem-solving in science, this finding implies the need for changes to educational objectives to prepare students with competence to work with GAI tools such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 in the future. Education ought to emphasize the cultivation of advanced cognitive skills rather than depending solely on tasks that demand cognitive intensity. This approach would foster critical thinking, analytical skills, and the application of knowledge in novel contexts among students. Furthermore, the findings suggest that researchers should innovate assessment practices by moving away from cognitive intensity tasks toward creativity and analytical skills to more efficiently avoid the negative effects of GAI on testing.

AB  - Most aerospace turbine casings are mechanised using a vertical lathe. This paper presents a tool wear monitoring system using computer vision that analyses tool inserts once that the machining process has been completed. By installing a camera in the robot magazine room and a tool cleaning device to remove chips and cooling residuals, a neat tool image can be acquired. A subsequent Deep Learning (DL) model classifies the tool as acceptable or not, avoiding the drawbacks of alternative computer vision algorithms based on edges, dedicated features etc. Such model was trained with a significantly reduced number of images, in order to minimise the costly process to acquire and classify images during production. This could be achieved by introducing a special lens and some generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This paper proposes two novel architectures: SCWGAN-GP, Scalable Condition Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty, and Focal Stable Diffusion (FSD) model, with class injection and dedicated loss function, to artificially increase the number of images to train the DL model. In addition, a K|Lens special optics was used to get multiple views of the vertical lathe inserts as a means of further increase data augmentation by hardware with a reduced number of production samples. Given an initial dataset, the classification accuracy was increased from 80.0 % up to 96.0 % using the FSD model. We also found that using as low as 100 real images, our methodology can achieve up to 93.3 % accuracy. Using only 100 original images for each insert type and wear condition results in 93.3 % accuracy and up to 94.6 % if 200 images are used. This accuracy is considered to be within human inspector uncertainty for this use-case. Fine-tuning the FSD model, with nearly 1 billion training parameters, showed superior performance compared to the SCWGAN-GP model, with only 80 million parameters, besides of requiring less training samples to produced higher quality output images. Furthermore, the visualization of the output activation mapping confirms that the model takes a decision on the right image features. Time to create the dataset was reduced from 3 months to 2 days using generative AI. So our approach enables to create industrial dataset with minimum effort and significant time speed-up compared with the conventional approach of acquiring a large number of images that DL models usually requires to avoid over-fitting. Despite the good results, this methodology is only applicable to relatively simple cases, such as our inserts where the images are not complex.

AB  - Background: The use of mobile devices for delivering health -related services (mobile health [mHealth]) has rapidly increased, leading to a demand for summarizing the state of the art and practice through systematic reviews. However, the systematic review process is a resource -intensive and time-consuming process. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to automate tedious tasks. Objective: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource -intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools. Methods: We used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews. Results: A triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps. This approach could be particularly useful for researchers with limited coding skills. However, the study has limitations related to the design science research methodology, subjectivity bias, and the quality of the search results used to train the language model.

KW  - RISK
AB  - In the face of climate change, climate literacy is becoming increasingly important. With wide access to generative AI tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, we explore the potential of AI platforms for ordinary citizens asking climate literacy questions. Here, we focus on a global scale and collect responses from ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on climate change-related hazard prompts over multiple iterations by utilizing the OpenAI's API and comparing the results with credible hazard risk indices. We find a general sense of agreement in comparisons and consistency in ChatGPT over the iterations. GPT-4 displayed fewer errors than GPT-3.5. Generative AI tools may be used in climate literacy, a timely topic of importance, but must be scrutinized for potential biases and inaccuracies moving forward and considered in a social context. Future work should identify and disseminate best practices for optimal use across various generative AI tools.
   Responses of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to prompts to list a country's vulnerability to climate hazards overall agree for floods and cyclones but less for droughts, with fewer errors from GPT-4, indicating a potential to enhance climate literacy, suggests a comparison of responses to hazard risk indices based on data from the IPCC.

AB  - BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery.MethodsThis article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians' expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI's potential.ResultsGenerative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies.

AB  - Since Manufacturing 4.0 faces various challenges, including the risks of data leakage and privacy violation, the struggle to meet the growing demand for personalization, and the limitations in harnessing human creativity, it has become crucial to embark on a transformation toward Manufacturing 5.0. To this end, we propose a DeFACT framework for parallel manufacturing and Manufacturing 5.0, which focuses on safe, efficient and personalized collaborative production. In DeFACT, different enterprises and parallel workers (i.e., digital, robotic and biological workers) are organized, coordinated and scheduled based on decentralized autonomous organizations and operations to promote mutual benefits among members, even in the context of low or zero trust. This contributes to providing customers with higher-quality personalized products and services while ensuring the confidentiality and safeguarding of data. Additionally, various advanced technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, scenarios engineering, and blockchain, are leveraged to achieve trustworthy and adaptable decision making, user-friendly human-machine interaction, and the federated control and management of parallel workers. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of DeFACT are experimentally validated through the design and implementation of three case studies.

AB  - Regarding tools and systems from artificial intelligence (AI), chat-based ones from the area of generative AI have become a major focus regarding media coverage. ChatGPT and occasionally other systems (such as those from Microsoft and Google) are discussed with hundreds if not thousands of academic papers as well as newspaper articles. While various areas have considerably gone into this discussion, transportation and logistics has not yet come that far. In this paper, we explore the use of generative AI tools within this domain. More specifically, we focus on a topic related to sustainable passenger transportation, that is, the handling of disturbances in public transport when it comes to bus bunching and bus bridging. The first of these concepts is related to analyzing situations where we observe two or more buses of the same line following close to each other without being planned deliberately and the second is related to the case where buses are used to replace broken connections in other systems, such as subways. Generative AI tools seem to be able to provide meaningful entries and a lot of food for thought while the academic use may still be classified as limited.

AB  - The revolution of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, and its implications for human-robot interaction (HRI) opened up the debate on crucial regulatory, business, societal, and ethical considerations. This paper explores essential issues from the anthropomorphic perspective, examining the complex interplay between humans and AI models in societal and corporate contexts. We provided a comprehensive review of existing literature on HRI, with a special emphasis on the impact of generative models such as ChatGPT. The scientometric study posits that due to their advanced linguistic capabilities and ability to mimic human-like behavior, generative AIs like ChatGPT will continue to grow in popularity in pair with human rational empathy, tendency for personification and their advanced linguistic capabilities and ability to mimic human-like behavior. As they blur the boundaries between humans and robots, these models introduce fresh moral and philosophical dilemmas. Our research aims to extrapolate key trends and unique factors in HRI and to elucidate the technical aspects of generative AI that enhance its effectiveness in this field compared to traditional rule-based AI systems. We further discuss the challenges and limitations of applying generative AI in HRI, providing a future research agenda for AI optimization in diverse applications, including education, entertainment, and healthcare.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the public's perceptions regarding the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in education by analysing comments on YouTube news clips. The study collected public comments from YouTube news clips disseminated by three prominent broadcasters in South Korea between December 2022 and June 2023. Two dimensions of public perceptions were examined: sentiments and prevalent topics. Employing machine learning techniques, we conducted sentiment analysis and topic modelling on the crowdsourced dataset of 18,566 comments from 66 YouTube news clips. The first research question focused on public sentiments towards GenAI and education. Findings reveal a predominance of neutral sentiments. Rather than adopting extreme positions of complete acceptance or rejection, the public displayed an inclination to appreciate the intricate nuances of GenAI's implications. The second research question sought to identify the main topics emerging from public comments on GenAI and education. We identified 11 distinct topics where two topics are directly linked to educational implications: demands for changes in learning and assessment methods, and the use of GenAI in higher education. Based on the key findings, we draw implications that can inform a broader understanding of public sentiment and perspective towards GenAI and education.

AB  - Since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, generative AI tools-capable of creating human-like content such as audio, code, images, text, simulations, 3D objects, and videos-have gained significant attention. While the impact of these tools on language teaching and learning has been widely speculated, the perspective of language teacher educators concerning their influence on initial language teacher education (ILTE) remains unexplored. This study investigates how teacher educators, who play a crucial role in adapting ILTE to technological advancements, perceive the effects of generative AI tools on ILTE. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with thirteen English language teacher educators from all four Hong Kong governmentfunded universities offering ILTE. Findings reveal that participants believe generative AI tools will substantially affect the ILTE curriculum, instruction, and assessment. However, most participants believed they lacked the confidence and competence to address the implications of generative AI tools effectively. This study highlights the need for further research and training to support teacher educators in adapting ILTE to the emerging influence of generative AI.

KW  - PREDICTION
KW  - MEDIA
AB  - The conventional approach to achieve desired effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of porous thermal interface materials (TIM) is processing-microstructure-properties forward analysis, which contains various trial-and-error cycles and is hence inefficient for materials development. Establishing the linkage from ETC to microstructure is essential; however, the recently developed methods including microstructure characterization and reconstruction are suffering from limited accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these problem, in this paper, generative artificial intelligence (AI) model was first implemented to design microstructure of porous TIM with desired ETC. Here, we introduced a representative porous TIM, sintered silver, and a typical kind of generative AI model, conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), as an example for illustration. The CGAN model can efficiently generate sharp and crisp microstructures of sintered Ag with excellent morphology realism. Besides visual inspection, the ETC values of generated microstructures were evaluated by convolution neural network (CNN) model. It was found that the CGAN model also exhibits satisfactory performance in physical meaning, since the determination coefficient R2 between target ETC and CNN predicted ETC values is 0.985. These results confirm the effectiveness of generative AI model capable of synthesizing microstructure of porous TIM with desired ETC, and not limited to porous TIM, the approaches present here can also be generalized and applicable to design microstructure of other porous media and composites.

AB  - This study aimed at examining the performance of generative artificial intelligence to extract argumentation elements from text. Thus, the researchers developed a web-based framework to provide automated assessment and feedback relying on a large language model, ChatGPT. The results produced by ChatGPT were compared to human experts across scientific and non-scientific contexts. The findings revealed marked discrepancies in the performance of AI for extracting argument components, with a significant variance between issues of a scientific nature and those that are not. Higher accuracy was noted in identifying claims, data, and qualifiers, as opposed to rebuttals, backing, and warrants. The study illuminated AI's promise for educational applications but also its shortcomings, such as the increased frequency of erroneous element identification when accuracy was low. This highlights the essential need for more in-depth comparative research on models and the further development of AI to enhance its role in supporting argumentation training.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, together with text and data mining (TDM), introduce complex challenges at the junction of data utilization and copyright laws. The inherent reliance of AI on large quantities of data, often encompassing copyrighted materials, results in multifaceted legal quandaries. Issues surface from the unfeasible task of securing permission from each copyright holder for AI training, further muddled by ambiguities in interpreting copyright laws and fair use provisions. Adding to the conundrum, the clandestine practices of data collection in proprietary AI systems obstruct copyright owners from detecting unauthorized use of their materials. The paper explores the exceptions to copyright laws for TDM in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan, recognizing their crucial role in fostering AI development. The EU has a two-pronged approach under the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, with one exception catering specifically to research organizations, and another, more generalized one, that can be restricted by rightsholders. The UK allows noncommercial TDM research without infringement but rejected a broader copyright exception due to concerns from the creative sector. Japan has the broadest TDM exception globally, permitting the nonenjoyment use of works without permission, though this can potentially overlook the rights of copyright owners. Notably, the applicability of TDM exceptions to AI-produced copies remains unclear, creating potential legal challenges. Furthermore, an exploration of the fair use doctrine in the United States provides insight into its potential application in AI development. It focuses on the transformative aspect of usage and its impact on the original work's potential market. This exploration underscores the necessity for clear, practical guidelines. In response to these identified challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid model for TDM exceptions emerges, along with recommended specific mechanisms. The model divides exceptions into noncommercial and commercial uses, providing a nuanced solution to complex copyright issues in AI training. Recommendations incorporate mandatory exceptions for noncommercial uses, an opt-out clause for commercial uses, enhanced transparency measures, and a searchable portal for copyright owners. In conclusion, striking a delicate equilibrium between technological progress and the incentive for creative expression is of paramount importance. These suggested solutions aim to establish a harmonious foundation that nurtures innovation and creativity while honoring creators' rights, facilitating AI development, promoting transparency, and ensuring fair compensation for creators.

TI  - Generative AI and simulation modeling: how should you (not) use large language models like ChatGPT
T2  - SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbots like ChatGPT, hold promise for advancing simulation modeling. Despite their growing prominence and associated debates, there remains a gap in comprehending the potential of generative AI in this field and a lack of guidelines for its effective deployment. This article endeavors to bridge these gaps. We discuss the applications of ChatGPT through an example of modeling COVID-19's impact on economic growth in the United States. However, our guidelines are generic and can be applied to a broader range of generative AI tools. Our work presents a systematic approach for integrating generative AI across the simulation research continuum, from problem articulation to insight derivation and documentation, independent of the specific simulation modeling method. We emphasize while these tools offer enhancements in refining ideas and expediting processes, they should complement rather than replace critical thinking inherent to research.

AB  - The emergence of generative AI has sparked substantial discussions, with the potential to have profound impacts on society in all aspects. As emerging technologies continue to advance, it is imperative to facilitate their proper integration into society, managing expectations and fear. This paper investigates users' perceptions of generative AI using 3M posts on Twitter from January 2019 to March 2023, especially focusing on their occupation and usage. We find that people across various occupations, not just IT-related ones, show a strong interest in generative AI. The sentiment toward generative AI is generally positive, and remarkably, their sentiments are positively correlated with their exposure to AI. Among occupations, illustrators show exceptionally negative sentiment mainly due to concerns about the unethical usage of artworks in constructing AI. People use ChatGPT in diverse ways, and notably the casual usage in which they "play with" ChatGPT tends to be associated with positive sentiments. These findings would offer valuable lessons for policymaking on the emergence of new technology and also empirical insights for the considerations of future human-AI symbiosis.

AB  - The identification and optimization of promising lead molecules is essential for drug discovery. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based generative methods provided complementary approaches for generating molecules under specific design constraints of relevance in drug design. The goal of our study is to incorporate protein 3D information directly into generative design by flexible docking plus an adapted protein-ligand scoring function, thereby moving towards automated structure-based design. First, the protein-ligand scoring function RFXscore integrating individual scoring terms, ligand descriptors, and combined terms was derived using the PDBbind database and internal data. Next, design results for different workflows are compared to solely ligand-based reward schemes. Our newly proposed, optimal workflow for structure-based generative design is shown to produce promising results, especially for those exploration scenarios, where diverse structures fitting to a protein binding site are requested. Best results are obtained using docking followed by RFXscore, while, depending on the exact application scenario, it was also found useful to combine this approach with other metrics that bias structure generation into "drug-like " chemical space, such as target-activity machine learning models, respectively.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the domain of multimodal teaching resources.

AB  - This exploratory analysis investigates the integration of ChatGPT in self-directed learning (SDL). Specifically, this study examines YouTube content creators' language-learning experiences and the role of ChatGPT in their SDL, building upon Song and Hill's conceptual model of SDL in online contexts. Thematic analysis of interviews with 19 YouTubers and relevant video contents reveals distinct constructs of ChatGPT-integrated SDL, suggesting a reconceptualization and refinement of the SDL framework in the consideration of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This framework emphasizes critical aspects of utilizing ChatGPT as an SDL tool on two distinct levels: 1) the interactive relationships and interplay between learners' personal traits and their ongoing learning processes (local) and 2) the evolving nature of SDL in the rapidly advancing landscape of generative AI, with socio-political-cultural foundations of AI constantly shaping the learning environment where SDL occurs (global). The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT as a tool for promoting self-directed language learning (SDLL) and provides implications for the development of learning technologies and research on AI-facilitated SDL.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.

AB  - In the last decade, despite rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) transforming many industry practices, construction largely lags in adoption. Recently, the emergence and rapid adoption of advanced large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Google's PaLM, and Meta's Llama have shown great potential and sparked considerable global interest. However, the current surge lacks a study investigating the opportunities and challenges of implementing Generative AI (GenAI) in the construction sector, creating a critical knowledge gap for researchers and practitioners. This underlines the necessity to explore the prospects and complexities of GenAI integration. Bridging this gap is fundamental to optimizing GenAI's early stage adoption within the construction sector. Given GenAI's unprecedented capabilities to generate human-like content based on learning from existing content, we reflect on two guiding questions: What will the future bring for GenAI in the construction industry? What are the potential opportunities and challenges in implementing GenAI in the construction industry? This study delves into reflected perception in literature, analyzes the industry perception using programming-based word cloud and frequency analysis, and integrates authors' opinions to answer these questions. This paper recommends a conceptual GenAI implementation framework, provides practical recommendations, summarizes future research questions, and builds foundational literature to foster subsequent research expansion in GenAI within the construction and its allied architecture and engineering domains.

AB  - Energy from fossil fuels is forecasted to contribute to 28% of the energy demand by 2050. Shifting to renewable, green energy is desirable to mitigate the adverse effects on the climate posed by resultant gases. Continuous flow hydrothermal liquefaction holds promise to convert biomass into renewable energy. However, sustainable conversion of biomass feedstocks remains a considerable challenge, and more process optimization studies are necessary to achieve positive net energy ratios (NERs). To fast-track this process development, we investigated the integration of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for data collection coupled with a support vector machine classifier (SVC). We trained the model on data labeled after the analysis of the aqueous stream by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Multiple test data, such as liquified wood and cotton, and dissolved glucose, were used to classify the aqueous streams. The results showed that fused original data achieves 84% accuracy. The accuracy increased to 93% after merging synthetic data from generative adversarial networks (GANs) and hand-crafted statistical features. The effect of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) on accuracy was also studied. We noticed that UMAP increases accuracy on some variations of the datasets, but it does not exceed the highest reported value. Shapely Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to investigate the contribution of the top 20 features. We discovered that features representative of glucose contribute positively to the model's performance, whereas those found in water have a negative influence.
   Energy from fossil fuels is forecasted to contribute to 28% of the energy demand by 2050.

AB  - Most experts agree that large language models (LLMs), such as those used by Copilot and ChatGPT, are expected to revolutionize the way in which software is developed. Many papers are currently devoted to analyzing the potential advantages and limitations of these generative AI models for writing code. However, the analysis of the current state of LLMs with respect to software modeling has received little attention. In this paper, we investigate the current capabilities of ChatGPT to perform modeling tasks and to assist modelers, while also trying to identify its main shortcomings. Our findings show that, in contrast to code generation, the performance of the current version of ChatGPT for software modeling is limited, with various syntactic and semantic deficiencies, lack of consistency in responses and scalability issues. We also outline our views on how we perceive the role that LLMs can play in the software modeling discipline in the short term, and how the modeling community can help to improve the current capabilities of ChatGPT and the coming LLMs for software modeling.

KW  - Quizizz AI
AB  - The incorporation of Generative AI and platforms like Quizizz holds immense potential to deliver substantial benefits to both English students and teachers. Students can readily create their interactive self-assessment tools, allowing them to monitor their learning progress independently. Meanwhile, teachers can facilitate and enhance students' independent learning, easing their workload, offering personalized insights, and boosting student engagement. Additionally, Quizizz AI can serve as a valuable resource for teachers looking to advance their professional development. Importantly, both students and teachers can explore new concepts at their own pace without the fear of judgment from others. While the platform offers numerous advantages for both educators and learners, several enhancements could render it an even more potent tool. By diversifying the types of AI-generated questions, the platform could create a wider range of activities targeting various English language skills. Furthermore, expanding the variety of AI-generated responses, such as voice or video, could facilitate the practice of productive skills like speaking. Additionally, written-text responses could promote writing skills. To further enrich the learning experience, the integration of AI for checking and providing personalized feedback on these responses might be considered.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a noteworthy milestone and a consequential advancement in the annals of major disciplines within the domains of human science and technology. This study aims to explore the effects of generative AI-assisted preservice teaching skills training on preservice teachers' self-efficacy and higher order thinking. The participants of this study were 215 preservice mathematics, science, and computer teachers from a university in China. First, a pretest-post-test quasi-experimental design was implemented for an experimental group (teaching skills training by generative AI) and a control group (teaching skills training by traditional methods) by investigating the teacher self-efficacy and higher order thinking of the two groups before and after the experiment. Finally, a semistructured interview comprising open-ended questions was administered to 25 preservice teachers within the experimental group to present their views on generative AI-assisted teaching. The results showed that the scores of preservice teachers in the experimental group, who used generative AI for teachers' professional development, were considerably higher than those of the control group, both in teacher self-efficacy (F = 8.589, p = 0.0084 < 0.05) and higher order thinking (F = 7.217, p = 0.008 < 0.05). It revealed that generative AI can be effective in supporting teachers' professional development. This study produced a practical teachers' professional development method for preservice teachers with generative AI.

AB  - The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is fundamental to conducting ethical research involving human subjects. IRB applications require detailed descriptions of the research and specific indications of how the research will be implemented. This can be difficult for inexperienced researchers. Preparing the application is a significant time commitment, even for experienced researchers. In order to lighten the administrative burden on busy clinical professionals, this software application will automatically generate a draft human subject research protocol (the most laborious element of an IRB application) based on responses to a short form. This technology uses generative AI and a custom literature search plug-in to draft the protocol from succinct, user-provided details. User inputs include a brief description of the research, including the hypothesis, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the study design type (e.g., randomized clinical trial). This tool can expedite the IRB application creation process, provide additional consistency for reviewers, and may reduce clinician researcher burnout through a reduction in clerical work thereby facilitating participation in meaningful research.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the "how"), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the "ideas"), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the "what"), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the "so what"). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a 'friend' yet a 'foe', (Paradox #2) Generative AI is 'capable' yet 'dependent', (Paradox #3) Generative AI is 'accessible' yet 'restrictive', and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even 'popular' when 'banned' (i.e., the "what"). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarok that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the "so what").

KW  - Math Problem-Solving
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive technology that is challenging traditional teaching and learning practices. Question -answering in natural language fosters the use of chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard and others, that generate text based on pre -trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The performance of these models in certain areas, like Math problem solving is receiving a crescent attention as it directly impacts on its potential use in educational settings. Most of these evaluations, however, concentrate on the construction and use of benchmarks comprising diverse Math problems in English. In this work, we discuss the capabilities of most used LLMs within the subfield of Geometry, in view of the relevance of this subject in high-school curricula and the difficulties exhibited by even most advanced multimodal LLMs to deal with geometric notions. This work focuses on Spanish, which is additionally a less resourced language. The answers of three major chatbots, based on different LLMs, were analyzed not only to determine their capacity to provide correct solutions, but also to categorize the errors found in the reasoning processes described. Understanding LLMs strengths and weaknesses in a field like Geometry can be a first step towards the design of more informed methodological proposals to include these technologies in classrooms as well as the development of more powerful automatic assistance tools based on generative AI.

AB  - Skin cancer, particularly the malignant melanoma subtype, is widely recognized as a highly lethal form of cancer characterized by abnormal melanocyte cell growth. However, diagnosing and classifying skin lesions, as well as automatically recognizing malignant tumors from dermoscopy images, present significant challenges. To address this challenge, our study employs variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively diagnose and classify various skin lesion types using the latest benchmark datasets ISIC 2019 and 2020. The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, which involves employing advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques i.e., Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN), for augmentation. These generative techniques are carefully evaluated and compared for their effectiveness. Our CNN-based approach involves aggregating results from multiple transfer learning models, including VGG16, VGG19, SVM along with a hybrid model in combination of VGG19 and SVM. On ISIC 2019, we have achieved promising accuracies of 92% for VGG16 and 93% for VGG19. Notably, the hybrid VGG19+SVM model exhibits the highest accuracy of 96%. On ISIC 2020, VGG16, VGG19, and SVM achieves accuracies of 90%, 92%, and 92%, respectively. Our findings underscore the potential of generative AI for augmentation, and the efficacy of CNN-based transfer learning models in improving skin cancer classification accuracy.

AB  - This paper introduces a media service model that exploits artificial intelligence (AI) video generators at the receive end. This proposal deviates from the traditional multimedia ecosystem, completely relying on in-house production, by shifting part of the content creation onto the receiver. We bring a semantic process into the framework, allowing the distribution network to provide service elements that prompt the content generator rather than distributing encoded data of fully finished programs. The service elements include fine-tailored text descriptions, lightweight image data of some objects, or application programming interfaces, comprehensively referred to as semantic sources, and the user terminal translates the received semantic data into video frames. Empowered by the random nature of generative AI, users can experience super-personalized services accordingly. The proposed idea incorporates situations in which the user receives different service providers' element packages, either in a sequence over time or multiple packages at the same time. Given promised in-context coherence and content integrity, the combinatory dynamics will amplify the service diversity, allowing the users to always chance upon new experiences. This work particularly aims at short-form videos and advertisements, which the users would easily feel fatigued by seeing the same frame sequence every time. In those use cases, the content provider's role will be recast as scripting semantic sources, transformed from a thorough producer. Overall, this work explores a new form of media ecosystem facilitated by receiver-embedded generative models, featuring both random content dynamics and enhanced delivery efficiency simultaneously.

AB  - The 2022 Medicare Fee-For-Service Improper Payments Report reveals an estimated $80.57 billion in improper payments, with a payment error rate of 15.62%. This paper uses generative AI to analyze and identify which provider types and HCPC codes are most strongly associated with these errors. The paper employs generative AI to produce two Python codes: one generates a time-series trend graph of Medicare improper payments from 2010 to 2022, and the other calculates the number of payment errors by provider type and HCPC code. These codes are designed for novice and non-programmers. Three datasets are used, such as Medicare Fee-for-Service Comprehensive Error Rate Testing dataset released on March 8, 2023, merged codes such as HCPC codes and PCT codes. The result suggests what systems should be improved to reduce Medicare improper payments. Generative AI is being introduced to help novice and non-programmers analyze Medicare improper payments with datasets, aiding researchers in conducting similar tasks in the future.

AB  - Background: Mentalization, which is integral to human cognitive processes, pertains to the interpretation of one's own and others' mental states, including emotions, beliefs, and intentions. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and the prominence of large language models in mental health applications, questions persist about their aptitude in emotional comprehension. The prior iteration of the large language model from OpenAI, ChatGPT-3.5, demonstrated an advanced capacity to interpret emotions from textual data, surpassing human benchmarks. Given the introduction of ChatGPT-4, with its enhanced visual processing capabilities, and considering Google Bard's existing visual functionalities, a rigorous assessment of their proficiency in visual mentalizing is warranted. Objective: The aim of the research was to critically evaluate the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard with regard to their competence in discerning visual mentalizing indicators as contrasted with their textual-based mentalizing abilities. Methods: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test developed by Baron-Cohen and colleagues was used to assess the models' proficiency in interpreting visual emotional indicators. Simultaneously, the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale was used to evaluate the large language models' aptitude in textual mentalizing. Collating data from both tests provided a holistic view of the mentalizing capabilities of ChatGPT-4 and Bard. Results: ChatGPT-4, displaying a pronounced ability in emotion recognition, secured scores of 26 and 27 in 2 distinct evaluations, significantly deviating from a random response paradigm (P<.001). These scores align with established benchmarks from the broader human demographic. Notably, ChatGPT-4 exhibited consistent responses, with no discernible biases pertaining to the sex of the model or the nature of the emotion. In contrast, Google Bard's performance aligned with random response patterns, securing scores of 10 and 12 and rendering further detailed analysis redundant. In the domain of textual analysis, both ChatGPT and Bard surpassed established benchmarks from the general population, with their performances being remarkably congruent. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 proved its efficacy in the domain of visual mentalizing, aligning closely with human performance standards. Although both models displayed commendable acumen in textual emotion interpretation, Bard's capabilities in visual emotion interpretation necessitate further scrutiny and potential refinement. This study stresses the criticality of ethical AI development for emotional recognition, highlighting the need for inclusive data, collaboration with patients and mental health experts, and stringent governmental oversight to ensure transparency and protect patient privacy.

AB  - Background: Generative artificial intelligence tools and applications (GenAI) are being increasingly used in health care. Physicians, specialists, and other providers have started primarily using GenAI as an aid or tool to gather knowledge, provide information, train, or generate suggestive dialogue between physicians and patients or between physicians and patients' families or friends. However, unless the use of GenAI is oriented to be helpful in clinical service encounters that can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes, the expected potential will not be achieved. As adoption continues, it is essential to validate the effectiveness of the infusion of GenAI as an intelligent technology in service encounters to understand the gap in actual clinical service use of GenAI. Objective: This study synthesizes preliminary evidence on how GenAI assists, guides, and automates clinical service rendering and encounters in health care The review scope was limited to articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Methods: We screened and selected 0.38% (161/42,459) of articles published between January 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023, identified from PubMed. We followed the protocols outlined in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to select highly relevant studies with at least 1 element on clinical use, evaluation, and validation to provide evidence of GenAI use in clinical services. The articles were classified based on their relevance to clinical service functions or activities using the descriptive and analytical information presented in the articles. Results: Of 161 articles, 141 (87.6%) reported using GenAI to assist services through knowledge access, collation, and filtering. GenAI was used for disease detection (19/161, 11.8%), diagnosis (14/161, 8.7%), and screening processes (12/161, 7.5%) in the areas of radiology (17/161, 10.6%), cardiology (12/161, 7.5%), gastrointestinal medicine (4/161, 2.5%), and diabetes (6/161, 3.7%). The literature synthesis in this study suggests that GenAI is mainly used for diagnostic processes, improvement of diagnosis accuracy, and screening and diagnostic purposes using knowledge access. Although this solves the problem of knowledge access and may improve diagnostic accuracy, it is oriented toward higher value creation in health care. Conclusions: GenAI informs rather than assisting or automating clinical service functions in health care. There is potential in clinical service, but it has yet to be actualized for GenAI. More clinical service-level evidence that GenAI is used to streamline some functions or provides more automated help than only information retrieval is needed. To transform health care as purported, more studies related to GenAI applications must automate and guide human-performed services and keep up with the optimism that forward-thinking health care organizations will take advantage of GenAI.

AB  - In the realm of Generative AI, where various models are introduced, prompt engineering emerges as a significant technique within natural language processing-based Generative AI. Its primary function lies in effectively enhancing the results of sentence generation by large language models (LLMs). Notably, prompt engineering has gained attention as a method capable of improving LLM performance by modifying the structure of input prompts alone. In this study, we apply prompt engineering to Korean-based LLMs, presenting an efficient approach for generating specific conversational responses with less data. We achieve this through the utilization of the query transformation module (QTM). Our proposed QTM transforms input prompt sentences into three distinct query methods, breaking them down into objectives and key points, making them more comprehensible for LLMs. For performance validation, we employ Korean versions of LLMs, specifically SKT GPT-2 and Kakaobrain KoGPT-3. We compare four different query methods, including the original unmodified query, using Google SSA to assess the naturalness and specificity of generated sentences. The results demonstrate an average improvement of 11.46% when compared to the unmodified query, underscoring the efficacy of the proposed QTM in achieving enhanced performance.

KW  - ChatGPT
AB  - The TrollLabs Open dataset includes comprehensive information that offers a comparison of design practices and outcomes between human participants and Generative AI during a hackathon event. The dataset was curated through the running of a prototyping hackathon designed to assess the abilities and performance of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the early stages of engineering design. This assessment involved comparing ChatGPT's performance to that of experienced engineering students in a hackathon setting, where participants competed by making a prototype that fires a NERF dart as far as possible. In this setup, all ideas, concepts, strategies, and actions undertaken by the AI-controlled team were autonomously generated by the ChatGPT, without human intervention or guidance, but implemented by two participants. Five self-directed baseline teams competed against the AI team. The dataset comprises 116 prototype entries and 433 edges (connection) that enable comparative analysis of design practices and performance between the team instructed solely by generative AI and baseline teams of experienced engineering design students. Prototypes and their attribute data were captured using Pro2booth, an online prototype capture platform running on participants' phones and computers. The dataset includes a transcript of the conversation between ChatGPT and the team responsible for implementing its recommendations, featuring 97 exchanges of prompts and responses. It contains the initial prompt used to instruct the AI, the objective and rules of the hackathon and the objective performance of teams, showing the ChatGPT team finishing 2(nd) among six teams. To the authors' knowledge, the TrollLabs Open dataset is the first and only open resource that directly compares the performance of generative AI with human teams in an engineering design context. Thus, it is intended to be a valuable resource to design researchers, engineering and design students, educators, and industry professionals seeking to find strategies for implementing generative AI tools in their design processes. By offering a comprehensive data collection, the dataset enables external researchers to conduct in-depth analyses that could highlight the practical implications of integrating generative AI in design practices, possibly providing an overview of its limitations and presenting recommendations for improved integration in the design process.

AB  - The current proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is prominently shaping the design industry. Generative AI, such as text-to-image and image-to-image models, has gained widespread use, notably for its efficiency and quality improvements. However, their potential to aid in cultural translation within creative design is underexplored. To address the existing gap, this study aims to assess the impact of generative AI on cultural translation within jewelry design. Specifically, a comprehensive study was conducted through a design-action experiment, collecting 46 student designers' design-action data and self-reports, and enlisting the evaluation from 30 design experts. The findings highlight the substantial influence of generative AI on the ideation phase of jewelry design, especially in depth rather than breadth, and in the shape factor at the technical level such as detailization and unexpected composition. Leveraging AI image generators has shifted the designer's focus from technical tasks to strategic decisions related to visual appeal, cognitive engagement, and emotional resonance. Furthermore, the challenges inherent in human-AI collaboration have been revealed, stemming from communication difficulties and the risk of fixating on specific details to stylistic constraints. Based on data analysis, a novel hybrid model regarding human-AI co-creation on cultural translation in jewelry design is proposed. Overall, this current study offers a valuable reference point to future research in terms of examining the effect of emerging technologies on cultural translation in creative fields.

AB  - The remarkable growth of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), has triggered a significant debate in society. It has the potential to radically transform the business landscape, with consequences for operations and supply chain management (O & SCM). However, empirical evidence on Gen-AI's effects in O & SCM remains limited. This study investigates the benefits, challenges, and trends associated with Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O & SCM. We collected data from O & SCM practitioners in the UK (N = 154) and the USA (N = 161). As we used the organizational learning theory for the research, our findings reveal increased efficiency as a significant benefit for both adopters and non-adopters in both countries, while indicating security, risks, and ethical as prominent concerns. In particular, it appeared that the integration of Gen-AI/ChatGPT leads to the enhancement of the overall supply chain performance. Moreover, organizational learning can speed up the results of Gen-AI/ ChatGPT in O & SCM. No wonders that adopters express their satisfaction about the post-implementation benefits of the technology, which include reduced perceived challenges for pre-implementation, and greater optimism about future Gen-AI/ChatGPT utilization compared to non-adopters. Adopters also display diverse behavioral patterns toward efficiency, agility, responsiveness, etc. This study provides valuable insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers interested in comprehending Gen-AI/ChatGPT's implications in O & SCM for both adopters and non-adopters. Additionally, it underscores the importance of organizational learning processes in facilitating successful Gen-AI/ChatGPT adoption in O & SCM.

AB  - Audiovisual digital media and tools are critical elements in contemporary human rights documentation and advocacy. Generative AI, deepfakes and synthetic media compound questions of what to trust in an existing situation of government suppression, difficulty proving witness accounts and broader societal challenges to trust. There is a need to 'fortify the truth' by fostering resilient witnessing practices that can ensure trustworthy videos and strengthen narratives of vulnerable communities. The author identifies and speculates on actions at tactical, strategic, tools, technology, and policy levels, drawing upon human rights organization WITNESS's work on proactive preparation for emerging technologies and technical infrastructures. Practical steps occur across a trajectory of using images and video in human rights advocacy and activism including filming, storytelling, watching, analysing, sharing, advocacy, and preservation. Guidance on filming must evolve to address deepfakes and opportunities and challenges in 'authenticity infrastructure'. Narrative video advocacy and formal legal and policy processes must adapt to new technologies including text-to-image and text-to-video, new disinformation threats such as 'floods of falsehood' and new presentation opportunities. The evolution of watching, scrutinizing, and sharing videos accountability amid increasing volume and normalized image manipulation includes positive dimensions of the 'media forensic turn', including collaborative 'open-source intelligence' verification, and negative aspects involving excessive scrutiny. Finally, preserving audiovisual media is critical, and emerging socio-technical infrastructure should be shaped for community control. Underlying principles for 'fortifying the truth' include taking a proactive approach, centring voices and needs of people facing human rights abuses, and working with and challenging technologists and technology companies.

AB  - This study investigates how inaccurate information provided by ChatGPT impacts travelers' acceptance of recommendations. Six experiments were conducted based on the accessibility-diagnosticity framework. These examined the moderating role of the prominence and type of incorrect information and their effects on decision-making. The results show that participants perceived more accuracy and trustworthiness, leading to stronger intentions to visit when incorrect information was absent. However, there was a decline in their intentions to visit when incorrect information was present and more prominent or in the same domain. This effect diminished when multiple domains were involved or when participants were focused on the initial task. The research highlights that both the prominence and type of incorrect information are boundary conditions and provides insights into AI applications in tourism. Furthermore, it offers practical implications for online travel agencies in terms of user interface and user experience design planning.

AB  - Qualitative researchers can benefit from using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), such as different versions of ChatGPT-GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, Google Bard-now renamed as a Gemini, and Bing Chat-now renamed as a Copilot, in their studies. The scientific community has used artificial intelligence (AI) tools in various ways. However, using GenAI has generated concerns regarding potential research unreliability, bias, and unethical outcomes in GenAI-generated research results. Considering these concerns, the purpose of this commentary is to review the current use of GenAI in qualitative research, including its strengths, limitations, and ethical dilemmas from the perspective of critical appraisal from South Asia, Nepal. I explore the controversy surrounding the proper acknowledgment of GenAI or AI use in qualitative studies and how GenAI can support or challenge qualitative studies. First, I discuss what qualitative researchers need to know about GenAI in their research. Second, I examine how GenAI can be a valuable tool in qualitative research as a co-author, a conversational platform, and a research assistant for enhancing and hindering qualitative studies. Third, I address the ethical issues of using GenAI in qualitative studies. Fourth, I share my perspectives on the future of GenAI in qualitative research. I would like to recognize and record the utilization of GenAI and/or AI alongside my cognitive and evaluative abilities in constructing this critical appraisal. I offer ethical guidance on when and how to appropriately recognize the use of GenAI in qualitative studies. Finally, I offer some remarks on the implications of using GenAI in qualitative studies

AB  - Background: Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize health technology product development by improving coding quality, efficiency, documentation, quality assessment and review, and troubleshooting. Objective: This paper explores the application of a commercially available generative artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) to the development of a digital health behavior change intervention designed to support patient engagement in a commercial digital diabetes prevention program. Methods: We examined the capacity, advantages, and limitations of ChatGPT to support digital product idea conceptualization, intervention content development, and the software engineering process, including software requirement generation, software design, and code production. In total, 11 evaluators, each with at least 10 years of experience in fields of study ranging from medicine and implementation science to computer science, participated in the output review process (ChatGPT vs human -generated output). All had familiarity or prior exposure to the original personalized automatic messaging system intervention. The evaluators rated the ChatGPT-produced outputs in terms of understandability, usability, novelty, relevance, completeness, and efficiency. Results: Most metrics received positive scores. We identified that ChatGPT can (1) support developers to achieve high -quality products faster and (2) facilitate nontechnical communication and system understanding between technical and nontechnical team members around the development goal of rapid and easy -to -build computational solutions for medical technologies. Conclusions: ChatGPT can serve as a usable facilitator for researchers engaging in the software development life cycle, from product conceptualization to feature identification and user story development to code generation.

AB  - The recent public release of the generative AI language model ChatGPT has captured the public imagination and has resulted in a rapid uptake and widespread experimentation by the general public and academia alike. The number of academic publications focusing on the capabilities as well as practical and ethical implications of generative AI has been growing exponentially. One of the concerns with this unprecedented growth in scholarship related to generative AI, in particular, ChatGPT, is that, in most cases, the raw data, which is the text of the original 'conversations,' have not been made available to the audience of the papers and thus cannot be drawn on to assess the veracity of the arguments made and the conclusions drawn therefrom. This paper provides a protocol for the documentation and archiving of these raw data.

TI  - Leveraging generative AI to prioritize drug repurposing candidates for Alzheimer's disease with real-world clinical validation
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Drug repurposing represents an attractive alternative to the costly and time-consuming process of new drug development, particularly for serious, widespread conditions with limited effective treatments, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies like ChatGPT offer the promise of expediting the review and summary of scientific knowledge. To examine the feasibility of using GAI for identifying drug repurposing candidates, we iteratively tasked ChatGPT with proposing the twenty most promising drugs for repurposing in AD, and tested the top ten for risk of incident AD in exposed and unexposed individuals over age 65 in two large clinical datasets: (1) Vanderbilt University Medical Center and (2) the All of Us Research Program. Among the candidates suggested by ChatGPT, metformin, simvastatin, and losartan were associated with lower AD risk in meta-analysis. These findings suggest GAI technologies can assimilate scientific insights from an extensive Internet-based search space, helping to prioritize drug repurposing candidates and facilitate the treatment of diseases.

AB  - The inferences of most machine-learning models powering medical artificial intelligence are difficult to interpret. Here we report a general framework for model auditing that combines insights from medical experts with a highly expressive form of explainable artificial intelligence. Specifically, we leveraged the expertise of dermatologists for the clinical task of differentiating melanomas from melanoma 'lookalikes' on the basis of dermoscopic and clinical images of the skin, and the power of generative models to render 'counterfactual' images to understand the 'reasoning' processes of five medical-image classifiers. By altering image attributes to produce analogous images that elicit a different prediction by the classifiers, and by asking physicians to identify medically meaningful features in the images, the counterfactual images revealed that the classifiers rely both on features used by human dermatologists, such as lesional pigmentation patterns, and on undesirable features, such as background skin texture and colour balance. The framework can be applied to any specialized medical domain to make the powerful inference processes of machine-learning models medically understandable.
   The inference process of medical-image classifiers can be audited by levering the expertise of physicians to identify medically meaningful features in 'counterfactual' images produced via generative AI.

AB  - This case study explored the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), specifically chat generative pretraining transformer (ChatGPT), in writing scenarios for scenario-based learning (SBL). Our research addressed three key questions: 1) how do teachers leverage GenAI to write scenarios for SBL purposes? 2) what is the quality of GenAI-generated SBL scenarios and tasks? and 3) how does GenAI-supported SBL affect students' motivation, learning performance, and learning perceptions? A three-step prompting engineering process (write the prompts, curate the output, and verify the output, WCV) was established during the teacher interaction with GenAI in the scenario writing. Findings revealed that by using the WCV approach, ChatGPT enabled the efficient creation of quality scenarios for SBL purposes in a short timeframe. Moreover, students exhibited increased intrinsic motivation, learning performance, and positive attitudes toward GenAI-supported scenarios. We also suggest guidelines for using the WCV prompt engineering process in scenario writing.

AB  - While the discussion on generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, is making waves in academia and the popular press, there is a need for more insight into the use of ChatGPT among students and the potential harmful or beneficial consequences associated with its usage. Using samples from two studies, the current research examined the causes and consequences of ChatGPT usage among university students. Study 1 developed and validated an eight-item scale to measure ChatGPT usage by conducting a survey among university students (N = 165). Study 2 used a three-wave time-lagged design to collect data from university students (N = 494) to further validate the scale and test the study's hypotheses. Study 2 also examined the effects of academic workload, academic time pressure, sensitivity to rewards, and sensitivity to quality on ChatGPT usage. Study 2 further examined the effects of ChatGPT usage on students' levels of procrastination, memory loss, and academic performance. Study 1 provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the ChatGPT usage scale. Furthermore, study 2 revealed that when students faced higher academic workload and time pressure, they were more likely to use ChatGPT. In contrast, students who were sensitive to rewards were less likely to use ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, use of ChatGPT was likely to develop tendencies for procrastination and memory loss and dampen the students' academic performance. Finally, academic workload, time pressure, and sensitivity to rewards had indirect effects on students' outcomes through ChatGPT usage.

AB  - Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study investigates the relationship between the perceived benefits, strengths, weaknesses, and risks of generative AI (GenAI) tools and the fundamental factors of the TPB model (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control). The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and students' intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages. Limitations and future research opportunities are also outlined.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact social work research. These technologies can produce high-quality written materials and support qualitative and quantitative data analysis with simple, plain-language prompts from users. However, they also introduce challenges, such as potential bias, data privacy concerns, and generation of misinformation. In this paper, we use a disruptive-disrupting framework to discuss the dual nature of generative AI and LLMs and offer recommendations for social work researchers and journal editors that include guidance around data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. Researchers must use great caution when deploying generative AI technologies, meticulously examining, verifying, and taking accountability for the text and analyses produced by these instruments. Likewise, journal editors will need to implement quality control procedures and ethical standards to guide and evaluate the use of these technologies in social work research. We consider the recommendations offered here as a point of departure for disciplinary conversations about the role of generative AI and LLMs in social work research.

AB  - This work aims at providing a solution to data scarcity by allowing end users to generate new images while carefully controlling building shapes and environments. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the most common network type for image generation tasks, recent studies have only focused on RGB-to-RGB domain transfer tasks. This study utilises a state-of-the-art GAN network for domain transfer that effectively transforms a multi-channel image from a 3D scene into a photorealistic image. It relies on a custom dataset that pairs 360(degrees) images from a simulated domain with corresponding 360(degrees) street views. The simulated domain includes depth, segmentation map, and surface normal (stored in seven-channel images), while the target domain is composed of photos from Paris. Samples come in pairs thanks to careful virtual camera positioning. To enhance the simulated images into photorealistic views, the generator is designed to preserve semantic information throughout the layers. The study concludes with photorealistic-generated samples from the city of Paris, along with strategies to further refine model performance. The output samples are realistic enough to be used to train and improve future AI models.

AB  - The dynamically evolving science of pharmacology requires AI technology to advance a new path for drug development. The author proposes generative AI for future drugs, identifying suitable drug molecules, uncharacteristically to previous generations of medicines, incorporating the wisdom, experience, and intuit of traditional materia medica and the respective traditional medicine practitioners. This paper describes the guiding principles of the new drug development, springing from the tradition and practice of Tibetan medicine, defined as the Interactive Nutrient Process (INP). The INP provides traditional knowledge and practitioner's experience, contextualizing and teaching the new drug therapy. An illustrative example of the outcome of the INP is a potential small molecule drug, 6-Shogaol and related shogaol derivatives, from ginger roots (Zingiber officinalis fam. Zingiberaceae) evaluated clinically for 12 months for biological markers of iron homeostasis in patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The study's preliminary results indicate that 6-Shogaol and related shogaols may improve iron homeostasis in low-risk/intermediate-1 MDS patients without objective or subjective side effects.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence has been regarded as a transformative tool. While responsible and ethical applications could bring opportunities to education, their misuse could pose demanding challenges. It is necessary to clarify the technological affordances and challenges in a normative way to lay the foundation for future development. This study addressed the dearth of literature by performing a systematic review, aiming to (i) explore the utility and availability from the technological affordances perspective; (ii) summarize the current challenges in risks prevention; and (iii) propose possible directions for future research and practice. A total of 27 academic articles published in core journals between 2020 and 2023 were analyzed, and the inductive grounded approach was used to categorize the coding schemes. The findings revealed four technological affordances: accessibility, personalization, automation, and interactivity; and five challenges: academic integrity risk, response errors and bias, over-dependence risk, the widening digital divide, and privacy and security. We propose future directions, encourage educational organizations to formulate guidelines for the ethical use of AI in education, call on educators to embrace future trends in AI education instead of shunning its use, and guide students to treat it as a thought aid and reference, rather than relying on it entirely.

AB  - Background: Patients with rare and complex diseases often experience delayed diagnoses and misdiagnoses because comprehensive knowledge about these diseases is limited to only a few medical experts. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge aggregation tools with applications in clinical decision support and education domains. Objective: This study aims to explore the potential of 3 popular LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI), and GPT-4 (OpenAI), in medical education to enhance the diagnosis of rare and complex diseases while investigating the impact of prompt engineering on their performance. Methods: We conducted experiments on publicly available complex and rare cases to achieve these objectives. We implemented various prompt strategies to evaluate the performance of these models using both open-ended and multiple-choice prompts. In addition, we used a majority voting strategy to leverage diverse reasoning paths within language models, aiming to enhance their reliability. Furthermore, we compared their performance with the performance of human respondents and MedAlpaca, a generative LLM specifically designed for medical tasks. Results: Notably, all LLMs outperformed the average human consensus and MedAlpaca, with a minimum margin of 5% and 13%, respectively, across all 30 cases from the diagnostic case challenge collection. On the frequently misdiagnosed cases category, Bard tied with MedAlpaca but surpassed the human average consensus by 14%, whereas GPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed MedAlpaca and the human respondents on the moderately often misdiagnosed cases category with minimum accuracy scores of 28% and 11%, respectively. The majority voting strategy, particularly with GPT-4, demonstrated the highest overall score across all cases from the diagnostic complex case collection, surpassing that of other LLMs. On the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care -III data sets, Bard and GPT-4 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy scores, with multiple-choice prompts scoring 93%, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 and MedAlpaca scored 73% and 47%, respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that there is no one -size -fits -all prompting approach for improving the performance of LLMs and that a single strategy does not universally apply to all LLMs. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs and the challenges associated with identifying an optimal prompting strategy that aligns with each language model's characteristics and specific task requirements. The significance of prompt engineering is highlighted, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners who use these language models for medical training. Furthermore, this study represents a crucial step toward understanding how LLMs can enhance diagnostic reasoning in rare and complex medical cases, paving the way for developing effective educational tools and accurate diagnostic aids to improve patient care and outcomes.

AB  - Background The spread of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to transformative advancements in diverse sectors, including healthcare. Specifically, generative writing systems have shown potential in various applications, but their effectiveness in clinical settings has been barely investigated. In this context, we evaluated the proficiency of ChatGPT-4 in diagnosing gonarthrosis and coxarthrosis and recommending appropriate treatments compared with orthopaedic specialists.Methods A retrospective review was conducted using anonymized medical records of 100 patients previously diagnosed with either knee or hip arthrosis. ChatGPT-4 was employed to analyse these historical records, formulating both a diagnosis and potential treatment suggestions. Subsequently, a comparative analysis was conducted to assess the concordance between the AI's conclusions and the original clinical decisions made by the physicians.Results In diagnostic evaluations, ChatGPT-4 consistently aligned with the conclusions previously drawn by physicians. In terms of treatment recommendations, there was an 83% agreement between the AI and orthopaedic specialists. The therapeutic concordance was verified by the calculation of a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.580 (p < 0.001). This indicates a moderate-to-good level of agreement. In recommendations pertaining to surgical treatment, the AI demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 80%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that the variables reduced quality of life (OR 49.97, p < 0.001) and start-up pain (OR 12.54, p = 0.028) have an influence on ChatGPT-4's recommendation for a surgery.Conclusion This study emphasises ChatGPT-4's notable potential in diagnosing conditions such as gonarthrosis and coxarthrosis and in aligning its treatment recommendations with those of orthopaedic specialists. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that AI tools such as ChatGPT-4 are not meant to replace the nuanced expertise and clinical judgment of seasoned orthopaedic surgeons, particularly in complex decision-making scenarios regarding treatment indications. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, further research with larger patient populations and more complex diagnoses is necessary to validate the findings and explore the broader potential of AI in healthcare.

AB  - Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major global health concern, but interpreting machine learning models for diagnosis remains challenging. This study investigates combining association rule mining with advanced natural language processing to improve both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. This novel approach has not been explored before in using pretrained transformers for diabetes classification on tabular data. Methods: The study used the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to investigate Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Python and Jupyter Notebook were employed for analysis, with the NiaARM framework for association rule mining. LightGBM and the dalex package were used for performance comparison and feature importance analysis, respectively. SHAP was used for local interpretability. OpenAI GPT version 3.5 was utilized for outcome prediction and interpretation. The source code is available on GitHub. Results: NiaARM generated 350 rules to predict diabetes. LightGBM performed better than the GPT-based model. A comparison of GPT and NiaARM rules showed disparities, prompting a similarity score analysis. LightGBM's decision making leaned heavily on glucose, age, and BMI, as highlighted in feature importance rankings. Beeswarm plots demonstrated how feature values correlate with their influence on diagnosis outcomes. Discussion: Combining association rule mining with GPT for Type 2 diabetes mellitus classification yields limited effectiveness. Enhancements like preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning are required. Interpretation challenges and GPT's dependency on provided rules indicate the necessity for prompt engineering and similarity score methods. Variations in feature importance rankings underscore the complexity of T2DM. Concerns regarding GPT's reliability emphasize the importance of iterative approaches for improving prediction accuracy.

AB  - Communication between Deaf and hearing individuals remains a persistent challenge requiring attention to foster inclusivity. Despite notable efforts in the development of digital solutions for sign language recognition (SLR), several issues persist, such as cross-platform interoperability and strategies for tokenizing signs to enable continuous conversations and coherent sentence construction. To address such issues, this paper proposes a non-invasive Portuguese Sign Language (Lingua Gestual Portuguesa or LGP) interpretation system-as-a-service, leveraging skeletal posture sequence inference powered by long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures. To address the scarcity of examples during machine learning (ML) model training, dataset augmentation strategies are explored. Additionally, a buffer-based interaction technique is introduced to facilitate LGP terms tokenization. This technique provides real-time feedback to users, allowing them to gauge the time remaining to complete a sign, which aids in the construction of grammatically coherent sentences based on inferred terms/words. To support human-like conditioning rules for interpretation, a large language model (LLM) service is integrated. Experiments reveal that LSTM-based neural networks, trained with 50 LGP terms and subjected to data augmentation, achieved accuracy levels ranging from 80% to 95.6%. Users unanimously reported a high level of intuition when using the buffer-based interaction strategy for terms/words tokenization. Furthermore, tests with an LLM-specifically ChatGPT-demonstrated promising semantic correlation rates in generated sentences, comparable to expected sentences.

AB  - As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have emerged as valuable assets in higher education. Despite their potential benefits in academic support, questions persist about the concrete advantages of integrating this technology into learning processes and its impact on academic outcomes. This research addresses this gap by investigating the influence of technology integration on academic performance, employing the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework and self-determination theory. The empirical findings from Chinese business students using Wenjuanxing platform reveal a positive impact of technology integration on business students' motivation, encompassing their learning desires, self-efficacy, and future beliefs, ultimately leading to enhanced academic performance. Notably, while epistemic curiosity augments the effects of technology integration on learning desires and future beliefs, its influence on self-efficacy is not significant. This suggests that curiosity alone might not be enough to alter deeply ingrained beliefs about one's capabilities. In conclusion, this study underscores the academic significance of these findings and their practical implications for educators and business students in optimizing ChatGPT's potential for academic success.

AB  - Background. This study evaluated whether generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based augmentation (GAA) can provide diverse and realistic imaging phenotypes and improve deep learning-based classification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) type in glioma compared with neuroradiologists. Methods. For model development, 565 patients (346 IDH-wildtype, 219 IDH-mutant) with paired contrast-enhanced T1 and FLAIR MRI scans were collected from tertiary hospitals and The Cancer Imaging Archive. Performance was tested on internal (119, 78 IDH-wildtype, 41 IDH-mutant [IDH1 and 2]) and external test sets (108, 72 IDH-wildtype, 36 IDH-mutant). GAA was developed using a score-based diffusion model and ResNet50 classifier. The optimal GAA was selected in comparison with the null model. Two neuroradiologists (R1, R2) assessed realism, diversity of imaging phenotypes, and predicted IDH mutation. The performance of a classifier trained with optimal GAA was compared with that of neuroradiologists using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The effect of tumor size and contrast enhancement on GAA performance was tested. Results. Generated images demonstrated realism (Turing's test: 47.5-50.5%) and diversity indicating IDH type. Optimal GAA was achieved with augmentation with 110 000 generated slices (AUC: 0.938). The classifier trained with optimal GAA demonstrated significantly higher AUC values than neuroradiologists in both the internal (R1, P = .003; R2, P < .001) and external test sets (R1, P < .01; R2, P < .001). GAA with large-sized tumors or predominant enhancement showed comparable performance to optimal GAA (internal test: AUC 0.956 and 0.922; external test: 0.810 and 0.749). Conclusions. The application of generative AI with realistic and diverse images provided better diagnostic performance than neuroradiologists for predicting IDH type in glioma.

AB  - Generative AIs are one of the latest, most amazing and exciting developments in AI technology. Indeed, these AIs have the ability to autonomously create original contents such as images, texts, sounds and videos: starting from a prompt - a description provided by the user these machines are able to 'generate' audiovisual contents in an almost completely indistinguishable from a human operator. Perhaps the time has come for philosophy to question about these tools and the effect they are able to have on their human users - a potentially disruptive effect, to the point of pushing the Hong Kong philosopher Yuk Hui to speak of "artificial imagination" in relation to the creative capacity of these machines. Facing Kant's thought about Imagination and its role in the process of understanding, we will try to explore the boundaries and characteristics of these machines, in order to be able to understand both their potential and the risks for human imagination.

AB  - University faculty immediately had many questions and concerns in response to the public proliferation of generative artificial intelligence programs leveraging large language models to generate complex text responses to simple prompts. Librarians at the University of South Florida (USF) pooled their skills, existing relationships with faculty and professional staff across campus to provide information that answered common questions raised by those faculty on generative artificial intelligence usage within research related topics. Faculty concern regarding the worry of plagiarism, how to instruct students to use the new tools and how to discern the reliability of information generated by artificial intelligence tools were placed at the forefront. By augmenting existing tutorials and instruction sessions, and creating a new information resource, the library was able to build a timely foundation to support future efforts to address the changing information needs of faculty and students using generative artificial intelligence programs and tools.

AB  - Humans often display a truth-bias-the perception that others are honest independent of message veracity-but does this phenomenon extend to generative artificial intelligence (AI)? We had humans and large language models make nearly 1,000 veracity judgments across different prompts. Human detection accuracies were near chance (50%-53%) with notable truth-biases (59%-64%); AI had a substantially greater truth-bias than humans (67%-99%). GPT-4 was also truth-default, not suspecting deception when veracity assessments were unprompted. Together, people and AI judge most information to be true.

KW  - teacher education
AB  - Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been part of our lives for some time, the launch of the Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) has given it renewed attention. While most of these debates are about higher education in general, this article focuses on schoolteacher education and teacher training. This research aimed to determine the contribution of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT in lesson planning, critical thinking and openness in education. The research used a qualitative approach and document analysis following an interpretative paradigm. The findings reveal that generative language models such as ChatGPT can provide specific materials and support mechanisms, such as lesson plans, to schoolteachers and student teachers. It also showed that ChatGPT has levelled the playing field by opening access to lesson plans to all teachers. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is crucial to approach these models with caution and critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases, understanding that they are tools to support teaching and learning and do not replace teachers. The study's contribution lies in ChatGPT-generated lesson plans' implications and the enhancement of critical thinking for teacher education, and it also underscores the need for further research to explore best practices for integrating ChatGPT in lesson planning.

AB  - Background: A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that opens up great possibilities for health care practice, research, and education, although scholars have emphasized the need to proactively address the issue of unvalidated and inaccurate information regarding its use. One of the best-known large language models is ChatGPT (OpenAI). It is believed to be of great help to medical research, as it facilitates more efficient data set analysis, code generation, and literature review, allowing researchers to focus on experimental design as well as drug discovery and development. Objective: This study aims to explore the potential of ChatGPT as a real -time literature search tool for systematic reviews and clinical decision support systems, to enhance their efficiency and accuracy in health care settings. Methods: The search results of a published systematic review by human experts on the treatment of Peyronie disease were selected as a benchmark, and the literature search formula of the study was applied to ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing AI as a comparison to human researchers. Peyronie disease typically presents with discomfort, curvature, or deformity of the penis in association with palpable plaques and erectile dysfunction. To evaluate the quality of individual studies derived from AI answers, we created a structured rating system based on bibliographic information related to the publications. We classified its answers into 4 grades if the title existed: A, B, C, and F. No grade was given for a fake title or no answer. Results: From ChatGPT, 7 (0.5%) out of 1287 identified studies were directly relevant, whereas Bing AI resulted in 19 (40%) relevant studies out of 48, compared to the human benchmark of 24 studies. In the qualitative evaluation, ChatGPT had 7 grade A, 18 grade B, 167 grade C, and 211 grade F studies, and Bing AI had 19 grade A and 28 grade C studies. Conclusions: This is the first study to compare AI and conventional human systematic review methods as a real -time literature collection tool for evidence-based medicine. The results suggest that the use of ChatGPT as a tool for real -time evidence generation is not yet accurate and feasible. Therefore, researchers should be cautious about using such AI. The limitations of this study using the generative pre-trained transformer model are that the search for research topics was not diverse and that it did not prevent the hallucination of generative AI. However, this study will serve as a standard for future studies by providing an index to verify the reliability and consistency of generative AI from a user's point of view. If the reliability and consistency of AI literature search services are verified, then the use of these technologies will help medical research greatly.

AB  - The advancement of generative AI technologies underscores the need for AI literacy, particularly in Southeast Asia's elementary Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) education. This study explores the development of AI literacy principles for elementary students. Utilizing existing AI literacy models, a three-session classroom intervention was implemented in an Indonesian school, grounded in constructivist, constructionist, and transformative learning theories. Through design-based research (DBR) and network analysis of reflection papers (n = 77), the intervention was evaluated and redesigned. Findings revealed clusters of interdependent elements of learner experiences, categorized into successes, struggles, and alignments with learning theories. These were translated into design moves for future intervention iterations, forming design principles for AI literacy development. The study contributes insights into optimizing the positive effects and minimizing the negative impacts of AI in education.

AB  - Generative AI, short for Generative Artificial Intelligence, a class of artificial intelligence systems, is not currently the choice technology for text analysis, but prior work suggests it may have some utility to assess dynamics like emotion. The current work builds upon this empirical foundation to consider how analytic thinking scores from a large language model chatbot, ChatGPT, were linked to analytic thinking scores from dictionary-based tools like Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Using over 16,000 texts from four samples and tested against three prompts and two large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4), the evidence suggests there were small associations between ChatGPT and LIWC analytic thinking scores (meta-analytic effect sizes: .058 < rs < .304; ps < .001). When given the formula to calculate the LIWC analytic thinking index, ChatGPT performed incorrect mathematical operations in 22% of the cases, suggesting basic word and number processing may be unreliable with large language models. Researchers should be cautious when using AI for text analysis.

AB  - In designing an intelligent tutoring system, a core area of the application of AI in education, tips from the system or virtual tutors are crucial in helping students solve difficult questions in disciplines like mathematics. Traditionally, the manual design of general tips by teachers is time-consuming and error-prone. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, presents a new channel for designing general tips. This study utilized prompt engineering and Chain of Thought to summarize general tips for given mathematical problems (one geometry problem and one algebra problem) and their solutions. A Turing test was conducted to compare ChatGPT-generated general tips with human-designed ones. Results from 121 human evaluators, each assessing 6 ChatGPT-generated and 6 human-designed general tips for each of two mathematical problems, showed that the average score for ChatGPT-generated tips is less than that of human-designed tips at a statistically significant level (p < 0.05), and Zero-Shot CoT achieved the best score. However, no evaluator could distinguish the tip types exactly. The average precision, recall and F-value of all ChatGPT-generated tips are less than 40%. AI-generated general tips can serve as a valuable reference for teachers to enhance efficiency and students' mathematical learning.

LA  - English
KW  - Generative AI
KW  - academic integrity
KW  - academic writing pedagogy
AB  - The capacity of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to perform at human-like levels on a range of tasks has created a challenging pedagogical tension within education. On the one hand, such tools pose significant threats to academic integrity, but on the other hand, employers will also expect graduating students to be proficient in the use of such tools so as to improve their productivity and performance levels. How best to balance this tension and produce students who can both work proficiently with discipline-relevant generative AI tools and also add significant value to anything a generative AI system can produce will be a long-term research project for educators. In the short term, however, since many students are already widely using or exploring the use of such tools, it is important for educators to clearly delineate for students what level of use is acceptable or unacceptable for each assessment task. To help educators frame any discussion with their students about levels of acceptable use, this paper proposes two frameworks for the uses of generative AI to support academic writing. The first framework is relatively simple, and generalises ideas from long term discussions around the support-collaboration-collusion continuum to the case of generative AI support for academic writing. The second proposed framework is two dimensional, considering the different levels of support possible at each of six stages in the academic writing process. In addition, since helping students learn effective "prompt engineering" will need to be a pedagogical goal, use examples at each level of the second framework are provided, together with commentary about effective prompt engineering, issues to watch out for, and possible ways to acknowledge any such use. It is hoped that the analyses and examples provided in this paper will provide useful foundations for both discussions between educators and their students, and future research into how best to integrate the use of generative AI tools in higher education pedagogy. Some suggestions for the needed research are also given. Since similar issues as those discussed above arise for research students when writing for publication, some discussion of these issues in relation to (evolving) academic journal policies in this area is also provided.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models will have broad impacts on society including the scientific enterprise; ecology and environmental science will be no exception. Here, we discuss the potential opportunities and risks of advanced generative AI for visual material (images and video) for the science of ecology and the environment itself. There are clearly opportunities for positive impacts, related to improved communication, for example; we also see possibilities for ecological research to benefit from generative AI (e.g., image gap filling, biodiversity surveys, and improved citizen science). However, there are also risks, threatening to undermine the credibility of our science, mostly related to actions of bad actors, for example in terms of spreading fake information or committing fraud. Risks need to be mitigated at the level of government regulatory measures, but we also highlight what can be done right now, including discussing issues with the next generation of ecologists and transforming towards radically open science workflows.

AB  - The Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of rotating machinery calls for a substantial amount of training data, posing challenges in acquiring such data for damaged industrial machinery. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic data using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with cycle consistency loss function known as cycleGAN. The proposed method aims to generate synthetic data that could effectively replace real experimental data. The generative model is trained to transform wavelet images of simulated vibrational signals into authentic data obtained from machinery with damaged bearings. The utilization of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrates a noteworthy resemblance between synthetic and real experimental data. Also, the generative model enables the synthesis of data that may have been entirely lacking from the experimental observation, indicating generative zero-shot learning capabilities. The efficacy of synthetic data in training diagnosis algorithms by means of Transfer Learning (TL) on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been demonstrated to be comparable to that of real data. The study has been validated by means of the test rig for medium-sized industrial bearings accessible at the Politecnico di Torino.

AB  - As ChatGPT has evolved, generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has gone viral on the internet since 2022. Heated discussions on generative AI have appeared in both social media and academic field, generating massive textual data. Overwhelming media coverage of generative AI may lead to biased conception. To date, there has been no systematic analysis of how generative AI is mentioned on the internet. Moreover, little attention has been paid to demonstrating the gap in perceptions of generative AI between social media and academic field. This study seeks to focus on the following specific research questions: What are the key terms related to generative AI, what are the key term differences in social media and academic field on generative AI, and what are the topic differences of generative AI in social media and academic field? A text-mining approach supported by KH-coder was employed. The research data were drawn from two main text sources: the Sina Weibo platform and the CNKI periodical database. The results revealed statistically significant differences in key terms and topics related to generative AI between the social media and academic field. Our findings enhance the understanding of public ideas and the trend of generative AI on the internet, and provide supportive information for future studies on generative AI applications.

AB  - Background: The current paradigm in mental health care focuses on clinical recovery and symptom remission. This model's efficacy is influenced by therapist trust in patient recovery potential and the depth of the therapeutic relationship. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness with severe symptoms where the possibility of recovery is a matter of debate. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes integrated into the health care field, it is important to examine its ability to assess recovery potential in major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) in comparison to mental health professionals to assess the prognosis of schizophrenia with and without professional treatment and the long-term positive and negative outcomes. Methods: Vignettes were inputted into LLMs interfaces and assessed 10 times by 4 AI platforms: ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Google Bard, and Claude. A total of 80 evaluations were collected and benchmarked against existing norms to analyze what mental health professionals (general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and mental health nurses) and the general public think about schizophrenia prognosis with and without professional treatment and the positive and negative long-term outcomes of schizophrenia interventions. Results: For the prognosis of schizophrenia with professional treatment, ChatGPT-3.5 was notably pessimistic, whereas ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard aligned with professional views but differed from the general public. All LLMs believed untreated schizophrenia would remain static or worsen without professional treatment. For long-term outcomes, ChatGPT-4 and Claude predicted more negative outcomes than Bard and ChatGPT-3.5. For positive outcomes, ChatGPT-3.5 and Claude were more pessimistic than Bard and ChatGPT-4. Conclusions: The finding that 3 out of the 4 LLMs aligned closely with the predictions of mental health professionals when considering the "with treatment" condition is a demonstration of the potential of this technology in providing professional clinical prognosis. The pessimistic assessment of ChatGPT-3.5 is a disturbing finding since it may reduce the motivation of patients to start or persist with treatment for schizophrenia. Overall, although LLMs hold promise in augmenting health care, their application necessitates rigorous validation and a harmonious blend with human expertise.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence has become a focal point of interest across various sectors due to its ability to generate creative and realistic outputs. A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models, enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept 'Generative Artificial Intelligence' lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation, analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and application of the term "Generative AI". While the broader public often interprets "Generative AI" as AI-driven creation of tangible content, the AI research community mainly discusses generative implementations with an emphasis on the models in use, without explicitly categorizing their work under the term "Generative AI".

AB  - In recent years, higher education (HE) globally has witnessed extensive adoption of technology, particularly in teaching and research. The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) further accelerates this trend. However, the increasing sophistication of GenAI tools has raised concerns about their potential to automate teaching and research processes. Despite widespread research on GenAI in various fields, there is a lack of multicultural perspectives on its impact and concerns in HE. This study addresses this gap by examining the usage, benefits, and concerns of GenAI in higher education from a multicultural standpoint. We employed an online survey that collected responses from 1217 participants across 76 countries, encompassing a broad range of gender categories, academic disciplines, geographical locations, and cultural orientations. Our findings revealed a high level of awareness and familiarity with GenAI tools among respondents. A significant portion had prior experience and expressed the intention to continue using these tools, primarily for information retrieval and text paraphrasing. The study emphasizes the importance of GenAI integration in higher education, highlighting both its potential benefits and concerns. Notably, there is a strong correlation between cultural dimensions and respondents' views on the benefits and concerns related to GenAI, including its potential as academic dishonesty and the need for ethical guidelines. We, therefore, argued that responsible use of GenAI tools can enhance learning processes, but addressing concerns may require robust policies that are responsive to cultural expectations. We discussed the findings and offered recommendations for researchers, educators, and policymakers, aiming to promote the ethical and effective integration of GenAI tools in higher education.

AB  - The growing digitalization of our society has led to a meteoric rise of large technology companies (Big Tech), which have amassed tremendous wealth and influence through their ownership of digital infrastructure and platforms. The recent launch of ChatGPT and the rapid popularization of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) act as a focusing event to further accelerate the concentration of power in the hands of the Big Tech. By using Kingdon's multiple streams framework, this article investigates how Big Tech utilize their technological monopoly and political influence to reshape the policy landscape and establish themselves as key actors in the policy process. It explores the implications of the rise of Big Tech for policy theory in two ways. First, it develops the Big Tech-centric technology stream, highlighting the differing motivations and activities from the traditional innovation-centric technology stream. Second, it underscores the universality of Big Tech exerting ubiquitous influence within and across streams, to primarily serve their self-interests rather than promote innovation. Our findings emphasize the need for a more critical exploration of policy role of Big Tech to ensure balanced and effective policy outcomes in the age of AI.

AB  - The emergence of generative language models (GLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, is changing the way we communicate with computers and has a major impact on the educational landscape. While GLMs have great potential to support education, their use is not unproblematic, as they suffer from hallucinations and misinformation. In this paper, we investigate how a very limited amount of domain-specific data, from lecture slides and transcripts, can be used to build knowledge-based and generative educational chatbots. We found that knowledge-based chatbots allow full control over the system's response but lack the verbosity and flexibility of GLMs. The answers provided by GLMs are more trustworthy and offer greater flexibility, but their correctness cannot be guaranteed. Adapting GLMs to domain-specific data trades flexibility for correctness.

AB  - The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in digital platforms has complicated the concept of truth in communication studies. The article presents the dichotomic framework of Front-end AI and Back-end AI to tackle the complexity of distinguishing truth. Front-end AI refers to AI technology used up-front, often as the face of a product or service, challenging the authenticity and truthfulness of content. In contrast, Back-end AI refers to AI technology used behind the scenes, which can generate misleading or biased content without disclosing its AI-generated nature. Addressing these challenges requires different approaches, such as verification and ethical guidelines for Front-end AI and algorithmic transparency, bias detection, and human oversight for Back-end AI.

AB  - This research paper intends to provide real-life applications of Generative AI (GAI) in the cybersecurity domain. The frequency, sophistication and impact of cyber threats have continued to rise in today's world. This ever-evolving threat landscape poses challenges for organizations and security professionals who continue looking for better solutions to tackle these threats. GAI technology provides an effective way for them to address these issues in an automated manner with increasing efficiency. It enables them to work on more critical security aspects which require human intervention, while GAI systems deal with general threat situations. Further, GAI systems can better detect novel malware and threatening situations than humans. This feature of GAI, when leveraged, can lead to higher robustness of the security system. Many tech giants like Google, Microsoft etc., are motivated by this idea and are incorporating elements of GAI in their cybersecurity systems to make them more efficient in dealing with ever-evolving threats. Many cybersecurity tools like Google Cloud Security AI Workbench, Microsoft Security Copilot, SentinelOne Purple AI etc., have come into the picture, which leverage GAI to develop more straightforward and robust ways to deal with emerging cybersecurity perils. With the advent of GAI in the cybersecurity domain, one also needs to take into account the limitations and drawbacks that such systems have. This paper also provides some of the limitations of GAI, like periodically giving wrong results, costly training, the potential of GAI being used by malicious actors for illicit activities etc.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionize Statistical Process Control (SPC) practice, learning, and research. However, these tools are in the early stages of development and can be easily misused or misunderstood. In this paper, we give an overview of the development of Generative AI. Specifically, we explore ChatGPT's ability to provide code, explain basic concepts, and create knowledge related to SPC practice, learning, and research. By investigating responses to structured prompts, we highlight the benefits and limitations of the results. Our study indicates that the current version of ChatGPT performs well for structured tasks, such as translating code from one language to another and explaining well-known concepts but struggles with more nuanced tasks, such as explaining less widely known terms and creating code from scratch. We find that using new AI tools may help practitioners, educators, and researchers to be more efficient and productive. However, in their current stages of development, some results are misleading and wrong. Overall, the use of generative AI models in SPC must be properly validated and used in conjunction with other methods to ensure accurate results.

AB  - Generative Pre-trained Transformers like ChatGPT are examples of AI systems which produce human-like responses in different forms such as text or images that have demonstrated excellent performance in producing logical and contextually relevant answers. However, the false positive/ negative detection of generative AI has been noted as a challenge. In this article, statistical ex-periments are conducted to test the chances of false positive and false negative detection of AI -generated text. It was found that the detected likelihoods of generative AI in articles' abstracts is much lower than that found in paragraphs taken from the literature section of the selected articles. This means that literature parts have higher likelihoods to falsely demonstrate AI -generated text. On the other hand, when genuine texts are compared with AI-generated texts, it is observed that there is a noticeable margin of overlap between their distributions and therefore type I and type II errors fall within the realm of possibility. We show that despite these challenges, generative AI like ChatGPT continues to be a promising tool for communication and information retrieval. However, it is vital to address the concerns regarding false detection of AI generated text and ensure that these models are used in ethical and responsible conduct.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In schools, teachers' perspectives are crucial for making sense of innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives of teachers and leaders. It used four domains - learning, teaching, assessment, and administration - as the initial framework suggested in a systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in education.

AB  - Aim: This study explores the potential of a generative artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) as clinical support for nurses. Specifically, we aim to assess whether ChatGPT can demonstrate clinical decision-making equivalent to that of expert nurses and novice nursing students. This will be evaluated by comparing ChatGPT responses to clinical scenarios to those of nurses on different levels of experience. Design: This is a cross-sectional study. Methods: Emergency room registered nurses (i.e. experts; n = 30) and nursing students (i.e. novices; n = 38) were recruited during March-April 2023. Clinical decision-making was measured using three validated clinical scenarios involving an initial assessment and reevaluation. Clinical decision-making aspects assessed were the accuracy of initial assessments, the appropriateness of recommended tests and resource use and the capacity to reevaluate decisions. Performance was also compared by timing response generations and word counts. Expert nurses and novice students completed online questionnaires (via Qualtrics), while ChatGPT responses were obtained from OpenAI. Results: Concerning aspects of clinical decision-making and compared to novices and experts: (1) ChatGPT exhibited indecisiveness in initial assessments; (2) ChatGPT tended to suggest unnecessary diagnostic tests; (3) When new information required re-evaluation, ChatGPT responses demonstrated inaccurate understanding and inappropriate modifications. In terms of performance, the mean number of words utilized in ChatGPT answers was 27-41 times greater than that utilized by both experts and novices; and responses were provided approximately 4 times faster than those of novices and twice faster than expert nurses. ChatGPT responses maintained logical structure and clarity. Conclusions: A generative AI tool demonstrated indecisiveness and a tendency towards over-triage compared to human clinicians. Impact: The study shows that it is important to approach the implementation of ChatGPT as a nurse's digital assistant with caution. More study is needed to optimize the model's training and algorithms to provide accurate healthcare support that aids clinical decision-making. Reporting method: This study adhered to relevant EQUATOR guidelines for reporting observational studies. Patient or public contribution: Patients were not directly involved in the conduct of this study.

AB  - This paper critically examines the transformation of the educational landscape through the integration of generative AI with Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practices (OEP). The emergence of AI in content creation has ignited debate regarding its potential to comprehend and generate human language, creating content that is often indistinguishable from that produced by humans. This shift from organic (human-created) to synthetic (AI-created) content presents a new frontier in the educational sphere, particularly in the context of OER and OEP. The paper explores the generative AI's capabilities in OER and OEP, such as automatic content generation, resource curation, updating existing resources, co-creation and facilitating collaborative learning. Nevertheless, it underscores the importance of addressing challenges like the quality and reliability of AI-generated content, data privacy, and equitable access to AI technologies. The critical discussion extends to a contentious issue, ownership in OER/OEP. While AI-generated works lack human authorship and copyright protection, the question of legal liability and recognition of authorship remains a significant concern. In response, the concept of prompt engineering and co-creation with AI is presented as a potential solution, viewing AI not as authors, but powerful tools augmenting authors' abilities. By examining generative AI's integration with OER and OEP, this paper encourages further research and discussion to harness AI's power while addressing potential concerns, thereby contributing to the dialogue on responsible and effective use of generative AI in education.

TI  - The Use of Assistive Technologies Including Generative AI by Test Takers in Language Assessment: A Debate of Theory and Practice
T2  - LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT QUARTERLY
LA  - English
AB  - Assistive writing tools that provide suggestions for word choice, sentence structure, and grammar correction are allowed as accommodations for students with learning disabilities on a case-by-case basis. These assistive technologies, including generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, are increasingly accessible to more people than ever and are being utilized for second language classroom instruction and learning. In light of this trend, at a meeting of the Automated Language Assessment (ALA) SIG at the Language Testing Research Colloquium (LTRC) in New York City, a debate took place on the topic of allowing access to assistive technologies including generative AI in language assessment. This commentary, building and expanding on the debate that occurred between two opposing teams who argued for or against allowing students' access to these assistive technologies during language assessment, extends the exchange of ideas in a written debate. The debate raises issues related to construct definition, scoring and rubric design, validity, fairness, equity, bias and copyright. The debate also speculates on the use of generative AI by test takers at different proficiency levels and different stakes (high vs. low) assessments. The debate ends with thoughts on AI's impact on language teaching and learning and when access to such technologies might emerge in language assessment. The issues and questions raised in the debate forecast discussions regarding the feasibility of allowing test takers to use assistive technologies including generative AI during language assessment and the extent to which humans interact and collaborate with these new technologies.

AB  - This study explores the capability of academic staff assisted by the Turnitin Artificial Intelligence (AI) detection tool to identify the use of AI-generated content in university assessments. 22 different experimental submissions were produced using Open AI's ChatGPT tool, with prompting techniques used to reduce the likelihood of AI detectors identifying AI-generated content. These submissions were marked by 15 academic staff members alongside genuine student submissions. Although the AI detection tool identified 91% of the experimental submissions as containing AI-generated content, only 54.8% of the content was identified as AI-generated, underscoring the challenges of detecting AI content when advanced prompting techniques are used. When academic staff members marked the experimental submissions, only 54.5% were reported to the academic misconduct process, emphasising the need for greater awareness of how the results of AI detectors may be interpreted. Similar performance in grades was obtained between student submissions and AI-generated content (AI mean grade: 52.3, Student mean grade: 54.4), showing the capabilities of AI tools in producing human-like responses in real-life assessment situations. Recommendations include adjusting the overall strategies for assessing university students in light of the availability of new Generative AI tools. This may include reducing the overall reliance on assessments where AI tools may be used to mimic human writing, or by using AI-inclusive assessments. Comprehensive training must be provided for both academic staff and students so that academic integrity may be preserved.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe widespread use of social media and recent development and use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has implications for the advancement of inclusive communication technologies to benefit people with developmental communication disability. This paper synthesises and critiques recent research on social media use in populations with developmental communication disability, discusses the intersection of social media and GenAI that could impact this population, and provides directions for future research.Recent FindingsThere is encouraging growth in the use of innovative methods to gather the views of people with developmental communication disability on their use of social media, advancing understanding of the risks they face and how they and their supporters manage these risks. However, there continues an underutilization of social media data published by and with people with developmental communication disability and a lack of co-design. Moving beyond patterns and purposes of use, future inclusive and co-designed research with this population should (a) include social media data, whether independently or co-produced with supporters; (b) explore the under-researched legal, ethical, and safety issues; (c) measure the outcomes and impact of social media publication in relation to the user or user group's emancipation, education, and enablement; and (d) consider the impact of GenAI on social media use for this group.SummaryContinued attention to the safe and enjoyable use of social media for all those who wish to use it, and foundational research on the uptake and use of GenAI, will be important to understand and support the advanced communication technology support needs of people with developmental communication disability. To inform future advances in both social media and GenAI for populations with developmental communication disability, future research directions are proposed.

AB  - The launch of new tools in late 2022 heralded significant growth in attention to the impacts of generative AI (GenAI) in education. Claims of the potential impact on education are contested, but there are clear risks of inappropriate use particularly where GenAI aligns poorly with learning aims. In response, in mid-2023, the Australian Federal Government held an inquiry, calling for public submissions. This inquiry offers a lens onto the policy framing of GenAI in education and provides the object of investigation for this paper. We use the inquiry submissions, extracting structured claims from each. This extraction is provided as an open data set for further research, while this paper focuses on our analysis of the policy recommendations made.

AB  - The motivation of this paper is to be able to generate high-quality (Structured Query Language) SQL language sentences in terms of syntax and semantics so that they are intended to achieve a concrete predefined and well-known aim. For example, generating SQL sentences that are capable of detecting a cyber-attack from a set of metrics available in a database table. Two solutions are needed to achieve so, a tool that enables and performs the syntactically valid generation of SQL sentences and an (Artificial intelligence) AI algorithm able to guide the semantics of such generations to the achievement of the best sentences for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this manuscript is the first of these solutions. To be concrete, this paper proposes a tool to enable and generate syntactic-valid language sentences. The tool can deal with any language defined as an ANTLR4 EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar. The paper also provides a methodology to help achieve an EBNF grammar suitable for addressing concerns related to ambiguity and recursion as a direct result of the generation process. The paper further implements a prototype utilizing ANTLR4's recognizer and its Augmented Transition Network for language generation using EBNF grammars. In-depth design and logic implementation are provided, showcasing areas of interest for AI integration. The achieved prototype showed an ability to easily generate syntactically valid SQL statements at various depths, with observable problems becoming more apparent during the exponential recursive growth. Our mitigation controls for such scenarios proved to be successful and were able to complete the recursion whilst also moving the push-down automata forward until query completion. Experimental validation was performed against a SQL EBNF grammar feeding the generated SQL statement into an SQL parser to validate the syntax.

AB  - This year, 2023, will probably be remembered as the year of generative AI. It is still an open question whether generative AI will change our lives for the better. One thing is certain, though: New artificial-intelligence tools are being unveiled rapidly and will continue for some time to come. And engineers have much to gain from experimenting with them and incorporating them into their design process. center dot That's already happening in certain spheres. For Aston Martin's DBR22 concept car, designers relied on AI that's integrated into Divergent Technologies' digital 3D software to optimize the shape and layout of the rear subframe components. The rear subframe has an organic, skeletal look, enabled by the AI exploration of forms. The actual components were produced through additive manufacturing. Aston Martin says that this method substantially reduced the weight of the components while maintaining their rigidity. The company plans to use this same design and manufacturing process in upcoming low-volume vehicle models. center dot Other examples of AI-aided design can be found in NASA's space hardware, including planetary instruments, space telescopes, and the Mars Sample Return mission. NASA engineer Ryan McClelland says that the new AI-generated designs may "look somewhat alien and weird," but they tolerate higher structural loads while weighing less than conventional components do. Also, they take a fraction of the time to design compared to traditional components. McClelland calls these new designs "evolved structures." The phrase refers to how the AI software iterates through design mutations and converges on high-performing designs.

AB  - Doctors are nowadays experiencing many struggles in their daily practice, mainly due to new intricate challenges of the twenty-first century. However, despite the efforts of traditional medical education, it falls short in providing them with the required tools to effectively overcome these difficulties. In light of these shortcomings, this paper suggests the development of a new educational framework designed to guide medical educators in creating student -centered learning experiences. Which may be ensured by using Design Thinking (DT) as an instructional design method, merged with constructive alignment principles, and generative artificial intelligence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new educational approach, a case study is showcased wherein the framework was applied to design a new medical curriculum. The case study specifically focuses on first -year students in a Moroccan medical faculty and was developed based on DT principles, allowing students to engage in a transformative learning process that encourages innovation and creativity. The new curriculum includes lecture sessions, hands-on workshops, and project coaching where teams of medical students learn the design process and are given the opportunity to prototype and test their proposed solutions at local university hospital units. Overall, the showcased case study provides evidence of the framework 's effectiveness in designing a new medical curriculum, illustrating its potential for enhancing medical education and engaging future doctors in impact -focused projects with long-term benefits for their career development.

TI  - Human favoritism, not AI aversion: People's perceptions (and bias) toward generative AI, human experts, and human-GAI collaboration in persuasive content generation
T2  - JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING
LA  - English
KW  - Generative AI
KW  - Algorithm Aversion
KW  - Human Favortism
KW  - Consumer Perception
AB  - With the wide availability of large language models and generative AI, there are four primary paradigms for human-AI collaboration: human-only, AI-only (ChatGPT-4), augmented human (where a human makes the final decision with AI output as a reference), or augmented AI (where the AI makes the final decision with human output as a reference). In partnership with one of the world's leading consulting firms, we enlisted professional content creators and ChatGPT-4 to create advertising content for products and persuasive content for campaigns following the aforementioned paradigms. First, we find that, contrary to the expectations of some of the existing algorithm aversion literature on conventional predictive AI, the content generated by generative AI and augmented AI is perceived as of higher quality than that produced by human experts and augmented human experts. Second, revealing the source of content production reduces-but does not reverse-the perceived quality gap between human- and AI-generated content. This bias in evaluation is predominantly driven by human favoritism rather than AI aversion: Knowing that the same content is created by a human expert increases its (reported) perceived quality, but knowing that AI is involved in the creation process does not affect its perceived quality. Further analysis suggests this bias is not due to a 'quality prime' as knowing the content they are about to evaluate comes from competent creators (e.g., industry professionals and state-of-the-art AI) without knowing exactly that the creator of each piece of content does not increase participants' perceived quality.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the pivotal axis around which transformation revolves is human-AI interaction. In this sense, this paper adopts a data mining and analytic approach to understand what the related literature tells us regarding the trends and patterns of generative AI research in educational praxis. Accordingly, this systematic exploration spotlights the following research themes: Interaction and communication with generative AI-powered chatbots; impact of the LLMs and generative AI on teaching and learning, conversational educational agents and their opportunities, challenges, and implications; leveraging Generative AI for enhancing social and cognitive learning processes; promoting AI literacy for unleashing future opportunities; harnessing Generative AI to expand academic capabilities, and lastly, augmenting educational experiences through human-AI interaction. Beyond the identified research themes and patterns, this paper argues that emotional intelligence, AI literacy, and prompt engineering are the trending research topics that require further exploration. Accordingly, it's in this praxis that emotional intelligence emerges as a pivotal attribute, as AI technologies often struggle to comprehend and respond to the nuanced emotional cues. Generative AI literacy then takes center stage, becoming an indispensable asset in an era permeated with AI technologies, equipping students with the tools to critically engage with AI systems, thereby ensuring they become active, discerning users of these powerful tools. Concurrently, prompt engineering, the art of crafting queries that yield precise and valuable responses from AI systems, empowers both educators and students to maximize the utility of AI-driven educational resources.

AB  - The study aims to explore the factors that influence university students' behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) of generative AI products from an ethical perspective. Referring to ethical decision-making theory, the research model extends the UTAUT2 model with three influencing factors: ethical awareness (EA), perceived ethical risks (PER), and AI ethical anxiety (AIEA). A sample of 226 university students was analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). The research results further validate the effectiveness of UTAUT2. Furthermore, performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation, price value, and social influence all positively influence university students' BI to use generative AI products, except for effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and habit show no significant impact on BI, but they can determine UB. The three extended factors from the ethical perspective play significant roles as well. AIEA and PER are not key determinants of BI. However, AIEA can directly inhibit UB. From the mediation analysis, although PER do not have a direct impact on UB, it inhibits UB indirectly through AIEA. Ethical awareness can positively influence BI. Nevertheless, it can also increase PER. These findings can help university students better accept and ethically use generative AI products.

AB  - Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, have the capacity to support both learners and teachers in higher education by providing quality prose with a requested specific focus. How that prose is appropriately utilised to support teaching, learning and the assessment of learning is currently being debated, with diverse opinions impacting Gen AI engagement policies across HE institutions. This paper is a personal reflection on using ChatGPT to support both my teaching and lecturing, and my students' academic and professional communication competencies. Examples are provided where my teaching and lecturing resources, specifically in health sciences, have been created and enhanced through the use of ChatGPT. As many of my students have English as an additional language or dialect, I include reflections on how these AI resources can enhance their learning, both linguistically and topically. This reflection also includes my own thoughts on how embracing Gen AI in learning can be assessed effectively and appropriately. Everything is provided with the understanding that all is open for debate and I welcome future comments and correspondence.

AB  - The European Union (EU) text and data mining (TDM) provisions are a progressive move, but the horizon is still uncertain for both generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models researchers and developers. This article suggests that to drive innovation and further the commitment to the digital single market, during the national implementation, EU Member States could consider taking the Japanese broad, all-encompassing and "nonenjoyment-based" TDM as an example. The Japanese "nonenjoyment" purposes, however, are not foreign to the European continental view of copyright. A similar concept can be found under the German concept of "Freier Werkgenuss" or enjoyment of the work. A flexible TDM exception built upon the German notion of nonenjoyment purposes could become an opening clause to foster innovation and creativity in the age of GenAI. Moreover, the article argues that an opening clause allowing TDM with "nonenjoyment" purposes could be permissible under the so-called three-step test. This article further suggests, if there is no political will to safeguard "the right to read should be the right to mine" and to provide a welcoming environment for GenAI researchers and developers, when shaping the legal interpretation through national case law, the EU Member States could consider the following: (1) advocate for 72 h of response if technological protection measures (TPMs) are preventing TDM, and (2) Robot Exclusion Standard (robot.txt) as a warning when TDM is not allowed on a website. It is now in the hands of the EU Member States, whether to protect the interests of rightholders or to create a balance between safeguarding "the right to read should be the right to mine," protecting rightholders exclusivity, and creating a supportive environment for the GenAI models researcher and developers.

AB  - Throughout industrial revolutions, equipment downtime mitigations have been one of the ultimate goals of most factories. Several tools, such as human machine interface (HMI) alarming systems or predictive maintenance schedules, assist in reducing system downtime but still depend on the operators' ability to swiftly retrieve, understand, and efficiently act upon reported failures. We propose the design of a hybrid experimental artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI chatbot HMI that effectively extracts factory equipment conditions that are useful for troubleshooting and predictive maintenance analysis. We achieve these functions by feeding experimental factory-monitored data to the customized chatbot application tool running in its back-end, a Langchain agent linked to the OpenAI GPT - \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$-$$\end{document} 3.5 language model (LM) via OpenAI APIs. We design our chatbot front-end with Streamlit, an open-source web app. In the context of I5.0, our chatbot HMI uses personalized natural language, English, to interact with the operator, making the information extraction more understandable. We also integrate the generative AI capability of the GPT 3.5 LM that augments the factory data based on the loaded format to create a larger dataset for additional tasks like machine learning modelling. The experimental results show the accuracy of our customized chatbot HMI when retrieving data based on specific prompts and the advantages of a reduced troubleshooting time compared to operations in traditional factories, which are highly dependent on supervisors' interventions. Our study provides a valuable example of upgrading standard factory HMIs to I5.0-capable ones by implementing customized AI and generative AI chatbots within operational industrial environments.

AB  - In alignment with climate change mitigation plans, renewable and sustainable energy integration into the industrial sector should be investigated for decarbonization purposes by 2050. This study aims to examine the feasibility of decarbonization of mega-scale industrial parks with two emerging technologies; first, an integrated energy system involving an air separation unit (ASU) and a liquid air energy storage (LAES)-based power generation system (ALPG) with the assistance of a large-scale liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and second, the green electricity predicted by various renewable energy (VRE) scenarios using an AI-driven generative model concerning techno-economic and environmental analyses. Firstly, the electricity demand of mega-scale petrochemical industrial complexes was allocated, and remote sensing data of VRE (wind and solar) were collected in South Korea. Then, the ALPG was modeled to consider the actual operation of an LNG plant near target complexes. Subsequently, the CC-informed VRE scenario generation model (CC-VRES) based on an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) algorithm was developed to generate VRE scenarios considering the CC effects. Finally, techno-economic and environmental assessments were conducted to target the mega-DIP by 2050. The results showed that the levelized cost of electricity of the proposed ALPG was 150 $/MWh, which is enough to supply the required sustainable electricity, considering the Korean energy plan and CC effects in the CC-VRES model. Therefore, the excess VRE can be used to decarbonize the target industrial parks; it is anticipated that 26,084 GW h/yr of renewable and sustainable electricity will be generated and cover the total electricity demand of Yeosu and Ulsan target complexes while reducing 13,943-kilo t CO2 eq./yr through 2050.

AB  - Background: The increasing application of generative artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) in various fields, including dentistry, raises questions about their accuracy. Objective: This study aims to comparatively evaluate the answers provided by 4 LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bing Chat (Microsoft Corp), to clinically relevant questions from the field of dentistry.
   Methods: The LLMs were queried with 20 open-type, clinical dentistry-related questions from different disciplines, developed by the respective faculty of the School of Dentistry, European University Cyprus. The LLMs' answers were graded 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) points against strong, traditionally collected scientific evidence, such as guidelines and consensus statements, using a rubric, as if they were examination questions posed to students, by 2 experienced faculty members. The scores were statistically compared to identify the best-performing model using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Moreover, the evaluators were asked to provide a qualitative evaluation of the comprehensiveness, scientific accuracy, clarity, and relevance of the LLMs' answers.
   Results: Overall, no statistically significant difference was detected between the scores given by the 2 evaluators; therefore, an average score was computed for every LLM. Although ChatGPT-4 statistically outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 (P=.008), Bing Chat (P=.049), and Bard (P=.045), all models occasionally exhibited inaccuracies, generality, outdated content, and a lack of source references. The evaluators noted instances where the LLMs delivered irrelevant information, vague answers, or information that was not fully accurate.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that although LLMs hold promising potential as an aid in the implementation of evidence-based dentistry, their current limitations can lead to potentially harmful health care decisions if not used judiciously. Therefore, these tools should not replace the dentist's critical thinking and in-depth understanding of the subject matter. Further research, clinical validation, and model improvements are necessary for these tools to be fully integrated into dental practice. Dental practitioners must be aware of the limitations of LLMs, as their imprudent use could potentially impact patient care. Regulatory measures should be established to oversee the use of these evolving technologies.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is one of the popular AI technologies which can produce multiple kinds of contents including music, text, image, as well as synthetic data. As GenAI technology can produce various forms of contents, organizations must face ethical dilemmas as to where this technology is likely to be used. Organizations do not want to compromise their ethical standards and compliance policies. Against this backdrop, the aim of this study is to examine if GenAI technology could improve the future performance of the organizations. This study deployed ethical dilemmas and environmental dynamism as two moderators acting on different linkages between adoption of GenAI and organizational future performance. With the help of literature review and theories, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually which was validated using PLS-SEM technique with the feedback of 326 responses from different types of organizations. This study found that the adoption of GenAI could improve exploratory and exploitative innovation under the moderating effects of environmental dynamism and ethical dilemmas. Moreover, it highlighted that the application of GenAI could improve organizational performance.

AB  - This study delves into the implications of incorporating AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, in higher education contexts. With a primary focus on understanding the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT among university students, the research utilizes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as the guiding framework. The investigation probes into four crucial constructs of UTAUT-performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions-to understand their impact on the intent and actual use behaviour of students. The study relies on data collected from six universities in two countries and assessed through descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling techniques, and also takes into account participants' gender and study level. The key findings show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence significantly influence behavioural intention. Furthermore, behavioural intention, when considered alongside facilitating conditions, influences actual use behaviour. This research also explores the moderating impact of gender and study level on the relationships among these variables. The results not only augment our comprehension of technology acceptance in the context of AI tools but also provide valuable input for formulating strategies that promote effective incorporation of ChatGPT in higher education. The study underscores the need for effective awareness initiatives, bespoke training programmes, and intuitive tool designs to bolster students' perceptions and foster the wider adoption of AI tools in education

AB  - This study aimed to explore the experiences, perceptions, knowledge, concerns, and intentions of Generation Z (Gen Z) students with Generation X (Gen X) and Generation Y (Gen Y) teachers regarding the use of generative AI (GenAI) in higher education. A sample of students and teachers were recruited to investigate the above using a survey consisting of both open and closed questions. The findings showed that Gen Z participants were generally optimistic about the potential benefits of GenAI, including enhanced productivity, efficiency, and personalized learning, and expressed intentions to use GenAI for various educational purposes. Gen X and Gen Y teachers acknowledged the potential benefits of GenAI but expressed heightened concerns about overreliance, ethical and pedagogical implications, emphasizing the need for proper guidelines and policies to ensure responsible use of the technology. The study highlighted the importance of combining technology with traditional teaching methods to provide a more effective learning experience. Implications of the findings include the need to develop evidence-based guidelines and policies for GenAI integration, foster critical thinking and digital literacy skills among students, and promote responsible use of GenAI technologies in higher education.
